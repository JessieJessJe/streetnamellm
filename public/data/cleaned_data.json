She spent the rest of the day working the pile, rescuing survivors and looking for her colleague Carlos Lillo, who unbeknownst to Torres, had lost his life in the collapse of the south tower. She continued on in her duty, rising to the rank of lieutenant in 2005. She also collaborated with Lillo\u2019s family to honor him by having a park named in his memory as well as with the Carlos Lillo Memorial Paramedic Scholarship. She died of 9/11 related illness.",

    "reason": "Brother Ralph Clifford, O.S.F. was born in the Bronx as Rodger Clifford in 1930 and was educated at St. Anthony of Padual in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. After graduating from St. Francis Prep in 1948, he entered the Franciscan Brothers, taking the name Brother Ralph on August 18, 1948. He was professed on August 19, 1949. Brother Ralph received a BS degree from Fordham University and a MS degree from St. John\u2019s University. In 1997, he was awarded an honorary Ph.D. from St. Francis College. He taught at St. Francis Xavier and Our Lady of Good Counsel schools in Brooklyn and St. Joseph\u2019s in Babylon, Long Island. He was principal of St. Brigid\u2019s Elementary School from 1961-1967. He was appointed assistant principal of St. Francis Prep in 1967. Bro. Ralph served as a member of the Board of Trustees for over 30 years at St. Francis College.Bro. Ralph changed every single student\u2019s life by just standing outside and talking to students. He did not just talk to them about how they liked Prep, but he took the time to talk and listen to the students about their life or any problems they were having. He always asked everyone how they were doing before he would ever talk about himself, which he rarely ever did. Brother Ralph Clifford died on November 30, 2002 from post-operative complications. On September 11, 2001 at 8:45 A.M. American Airlines Flight 11, a jet carrying 92 passengers that was hijacked on a flight from Boston, Massachusetts, crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center. The impact of the jet tore a huge hole in the building and set it afire, trapping hundreds of people on the upper floors. At 9:03 A.M. a second hijacked jet airliner, United Airlines Flight 175, with 65 passengers also out of Boston, crashed into the south tower of the World Trade Center. The plane exploded causing a fire that trapped everyone in the building who was above the point of impact. Within the next ninety minutes both towers collapsed.Despite the heroic efforts of New York City\u2019s Fire Department, Police Department, Emergency Services Unit, and hundreds of civilians, more than 2,800 people were killed when the World Trade Center came down. Included among the casualties were firefighters, police officers, emergency medical technicians, airline passengers and crewmembers, those who worked or had business in the World Trade Center, and civilians on the ground. It is the view of the New York City Council, and millions of Americans, that all of the people who lost their lives in this terrorist attack are heroes as well as victims. Today we celebrate their lives and mourn their passing by naming the following streets in honor of those heroes. While honoring them, we also acknowledge that it is but a modest gesture when compared to their great and ultimate sacrifice. This is the sixth piece of legislation that the Council has considered to rename streets and other public places in their honor. The following forty-two sections of the bill are to honor these individuals.",

    "reason": "Joseph Magnus was the co-founder of the Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps. When he was 13 years old living in Czechoslovakia during World War II, his life was very difficult. In 1944, the Russians had beaten the Germans back to the small Czech town of Roztoky where Magnus and his mother lived. They were forced to flee with other townspeople into the surrounding woods where they dug themselves bunkers and huddled down, trying to evade capture and death. One night, the Germans invaded and herded people, including the Magnuses, onto trains and locked them inside. Some of the older men had avoided being captured, killed the guards and then freed everyone. Joe and his mother immediately found themselves hiding in the woods again. They dodged many a bullet while scrounging for potatoes at nearby farms that had been abandoned. \u201cOne night we were running from a German soldier on a horse and I tripped and fell into a puddle,\u201d Magnus recalled. \u201cThank God the horse just jumped right over me and kept going.\u201d Joe also remembers a shell exploding five feet from where he had been sitting with some other boys. This left him with a deep gash on his leg. \u201cI was bleeding terribly, and one of my friends took his shirt and tied it on (the wound). If not for that, I might be dead,\u201d Magnus said. A few months later, he was shot through his arm, the bullet barely missing the bone. Unfortunately, calling a doctor was out of the question. All of the doctors had been called to serve the Allied troops on the front lines. Emergencies had to be taken care of by people with little to no training in medicine. After living through the nightmare that was World War II in Czechoslovakia, Joe wanted to use his keen survival skills to help others. In 1952, he immigrated to America. In 1973, he was working on computer mainframes for a government agency full time, but spent his free time learning first aid and soliciting donations so the original group of 12 Middle Village Volunteer Ambulance Corps (MVVAC) volunteers could buy an ambulance. Within a short time, they had a $500 vehicle and were ready to assist those in need. Today, MVVAC has dozens of volunteers and its service area is home to more than 70,000 people. The corps\u2019 services are free of charge and they do not take insurance. Shortly after the first strike on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, he and members of MVVAC dropped what they were doing and rushed downtown to help save people. For the heroism displayed by MVVAC on that day, they received $5,000 from Emigrant Savings Bank.",

The overseer hit her in the head with a lead weight, which put Harriet in a coma. It took months for her to recover, and for the rest of her life, Harriet suffered from blackouts. In 1844, Harriet married a free black man named John Tubman. Harriet remained a slave, but she was able to stay in Tubman's cabin at night. Although she was married, Harriet lived in fear of being shipped to the deep South, a virtual death sentence for any slave. In 1849, her fears were realized when the owner of the Brodas plantation died and many of the slaves were scheduled to be sold. After hearing of her fate, Harriet planned to escape that very night. She knew her husband would expose her, so the only person she informed was her sister. Harriet made the 90 mile trip to the Mason-Dixon line with the help of contacts along the Underground Railroad. She had to hike through swamps and woodland. Harriet's trip was successful, and she settled in Philadelphia. She worked as a dishwasher and made plans to rescue her family. The next year, Harriet traveled back to Maryland and rescued her sister's family. She then returned to transport her brothers to the North. She went back for her husband, but he had remarried and did not want to follow her. In 1857, Harriet finally returned for her parents and settled them in Auburn, New York. By this time, Harriet was becoming quite well known and huge rewards were offered for her capture. Harriet was the master of disguise. A former master did not even recognize her when they ran into each other on the street. She was nicknamed the \"Moses of her people\" for leading them to freedom. In all, Harriet made 19 trips on the Underground Railroad and freed more than 300 slaves. With the arrival of the Civil War, Harriet became a spy for the Union army. She later worked in Washington DC as a government nurse. Although Harriet won admiration from the military, she did not receive a government pension for more than 30 years. At the end of the war, Harriet returned to her parents in Auburn. She was extremely poor and the profits of a book by Sarah Bradford entitled \u201cScenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman\u201d, published in 1869 were a great financial help. In 1870, Harriet married Nelson Davis, who she had met at a South Carolina army base. They were happily married for 18 years until Davis' death. In 1896, Harriet purchased land to build a home for sick and needy blacks. However, she was unable to raise enough money to build the house and ultimately gave the land to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. The church completed the home in 1908, and Harriet moved there several years later. She spent her last years in the home telling stories of her life to visitors. On March 10, 1913, Harriet died of pneumonia. She was 93 years old. Harriet Tubman was not afraid to fight for the rights of African-Americans. Her story is one of dedication and inspiration. During her lifetime Harriet was honored by many people. In 1897, her bravery even inspired Queen Victoria to award her a silver medal.",

    "reason": "Amadou Diallo was born on September 2, 1975 in the village of Sinoe, Liberia, West Africa. He was the first of four children born to Saikou and Kadiatou Diallo. Amadou has one sister, Laouratou, and two brothers, Ibrahima and Abdul Salaam. Because his father, Saikou, was a businessman, Amadou traveled throughout much of his childhood living in Togo, Guinea, the homeland of his parents, Bangkok and Singapore.Amadou grew up with a love of reading, music, dancing and sports. Once in the United States, he became an avid basketball fan, in particular, of Michael Jordan. In fact, Amadou was such a true Michael Jordan fan that he shifted from a Bulls fan to a Knicks fan when Jordan had decided to retire.Amadou had a passion for school and attended some of the finest schools in the world, including The French International School, London's Cambridge University, The British Consulate College in Thailand and the Asian Institute of Microsoft. It was Amadou's dream to one day enroll in school in the United States. At twenty, he decided to come to America to continue his computer education and he wanted to do it on his own. In September of 1996, he decided to come to New York to start a business with his cousin. His father, Saikou, was reluctant at first but later relented after he was reassured by relatives that Amadou would be taken care of. Upon his arrival in New York, he first worked as a delivery man but later became a street peddler selling gloves, socks and video tapes in Manhattan on 14th Street. He worked six days a week, 12 hours a day. However, his dream to pursue his education in America continued. A young man from Senegal who met Amadou in New York fondly recalls the times he and Amadou would sit talking for hours about school. After class, he'd stop by Amadou's stand where Amadou would always have a cold bottle of apple juice waiting for him. He'd take his usual seat while Amadou would run down his usual questions; \"So tell me, how was school in America today? How do you feel about being in the classroom?\" He'd get so excited just listening and, at the end of every conversation, he'd say, \"You know, I'm really going to go to school here someday.\"A spiritual person, when Amadou was about 18 years old, he began to focus and collect books on his religion, studying the Koran and praying five times a day in the Muslim tradition. When the family came to collect Amadou's belongings after his death, they found solace in what they discovered. Among the many things they found were writings where Amadou had begun to research the prophets. He had written the names of all the prophets along with the dates of their birth. He had highlighted passages in the Koran that spoke about the dialogues between Christians and Muslims. Amadou was on a spiritual journey.Amadou was killed on February 4, 1999, after midnight, by four New York City police officers from the Street Crime Unit. Amadou had come home from work to his apartment at 1157 Wheeler Avenue in the Soundview Section of the Bronx and decided to go back out to get something to eat. Upon his return, he encountered the police officers who ultimately fired a fuselage of 41 shots, 19 of which riddled his body. Amadou died in the vestibule of his apartment building.",

    "reason": "Bobby Bello was born and raised in Bay Ridge. The youngest of nine children, he was born on June 4, 1927 to Tony and Netti Bello. He attended P.S. 105, Pershing Junior High School and graduated from Fort Hamilton High School in 1945. After high school he served in the Air Force for two years. Bobby was a member of the Local #40 Iron Works union for the next forty years. He worked on various projects in the New York City area, among them the Twin Towers and the Verrazano Narrows Bridge. This brought him a sense of great pride and joy, especially when connecting his beloved Bay Ridge with his new home Staten Island.In 1952 at a Father Strype fund raising dance Bob met and later fell in love with Margaret Moakler. Two years later on October 16, 1954 in the upper church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, Bob and Margie were married by her brother Father Michael Moakler. Together they had five children, Bonnie, Robert, Phillip, Stephen, and Toniann.In 1973, Bob was laid up suffering from a back injury. At that time he encouraged Maggie to go to college. Four years later she graduated with honors from Richmond College. Later, again with his encouragement, she would also acquire her Masters Degree from Saint John\u2019s University. In the year 2000 she retired from Saint Patrick\u2019s School after teaching the second grade for twenty years.Bob\u2019s chosen sport was football. As a little boy on 7th avenue and 59th street, his dream was to be a good football player. He\u2019d often reminiscence about his days at the \u201cDust Bowl\u201d field. How he took old newspapers, rolled them together tightly, wrapped them with string or rubber bands and call that his football. He would take his \u201cball\u201d to the Dust Bowl, throw the ball down the field, run back and catch it. Bob would be there for hours learning to \u201crun and catch\u201d. Since Fort Hamilton did not have a football team, Bob played with the local sand lot teams, such as The Hawks, The Imps, and the Bay Ridge Celtics where he was both a player and a coach. One year he played semi-pro football for the Indians. The last game he played was on his endeared Shore Road Football field, he was 38 years old.Bob\u2019s coaching abilities were becoming well known in Bay Ridge. In 1955, Bob, together with the youth officer Ray Rupelli, of the 64th precinct located then on the corner of 86th street and 5th avenue, began the \u201cPolice Athletic League\u201d (P.A.L.), which till this day still flourishes under the title of 68th precinct Youth Council. At the time he was also coaching in the Pop Warner Football League. The games were played on their home field at Shore Road and 79th street. Ironically enough, this field at 79th street and Shore Road is now the home field of the Xaverian Clippers Football team which is coached by Dom Laurendi, who was one of Bob\u2019s early ball players. He coached and nurtured thousands of young boys through out those years, and one outstanding young man was the New York Jets John Dockery. Over the years John never forgot his \u201ccoach,\u201d Bobby Bello. Later, Bob opened a sporting goods store on 77th street and 5th avenue and many of his \u201ckids\u201d, now mature young men, would stop by to recall the good times they had with the P.A.L. John Dockery was one of these \u201ckids.\u201d Bob was proud to know that his Bay Ridge local boy had won an athletic scholarship to Harvard University. Dockery also won a Superbowl Ring with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Shortly afterwards, Joe Namath and Dockery joined forces and began the \u201cJoe Namath and John Dockery Football Camp\u201d. Bob was one of the first coaches to join the camp. Further more, he was a part of that camp up to the time of his death, some 27 years in all.Bob\u2019s world of coaching took him down many paths and to many fields as he coached New York Police Department Football teams, numerous high school teams such as, Tilden, Monsignor Farrell, and Tottenville High School. In 1992 the New York Finest were the champs in the Policeman\u2019s Benevolent Association Fun City Bowl in Florida, and in 1997, the Tottenville \u201cpirates\u201d were the New York City P.S.A.L. Champions. On both Occasions he received a ring in his name, a dream come true. He was very proud of these rings and \u201cHis\u201d boys. With all the devotion and hard work that he gave to his coaching, one would think that coaching was his first love. But this was not the case.Bobby Bello\u2019s first and heartfelt love belonged to his family. His wife Margie, their five children, eight grandchildren, his brothers and sisters, and their children. He felt proud to have coached his sons Robert, Phillip, and Stephen, his nephews Michael, Robert, Joseph, and later his son Joseph the III, and then his grandsons Robert and Sean. This for Bob was a joyful accomplishment. Bobby Bello\u2019s football days started alone on the \u201cDust Bowl\u201d field, but his accomplishments, his achievements, and his adulation began on the fields of Shore Road. Bobby Bello died on February 16, 1999.Bobby was not only a great football player and coach, but he was an exceptional, outstanding and magnificent man. A man whose name will give honor and due respect to this field.",

    "reason": "Father Michael McGivney was born in Waterbury on August 12, 1852. The oldest of thirteen children of Irish immigrants Patrick and Mary (Lynch) McGivney, Michael learned early about sorrow, the harsh grip of poverty, love and faith, and family fortitude. Six of his siblings died in infancy or childhood. At the age of 13 he left school to work in a spoon-making department of a brass factory to provide a few more dollars for family survival. When he reached the age of sixteen, he traveled to Quebec, Canada with his Waterbury pastor and registered at the French-run College of St. Hyacinthe. With the priesthood clearly in mind, he worked hard on subjects that would prepare him to apply for seminary admission. He studied two additional years at Our Lady of Angels Seminary in Niagra Falls, New York. He then moved to Montreal to attend seminary classes at the Jesuit-run St. Mary's College. When his father died in June of 1873, he went home for the funeral concerned for his family's welfare, lingering awhile in Waterbury. Then, at the request of the bishop of Hartford, he entered St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland. On December 22, 1877, he was ordained in Baltimore's historic Cathedral of the Assumption by Archbishop (later Cardinal) James Gibbons. A few days later, he said his first Mass at Immaculate Conception Church in Waterbury. Father McGivney began his priestly ministry on Christmas Day in 1877 as curate at St. Mary's Church in New Haven. It was the city's first parish. A new stone church had been built, after the old one burned, on one of New Haven's finest residential Streets, Hillhouse Avenue. There was neighborhood objection which even the New York Times noted in 1879, under the headline: \"How An Aristocratic Avenue Was Blemished By A Roman Church Edifice.\" So Father McGivney's priestly ministry in New Haven began with tension and defensiveness among the working-class Irish families he served. Father McGivney worked closely with the young people of St. Mary's parish, holding catechism classes and organizing a total abstinence society to fight alcoholism. In 1881 he began to explore with various laymen the idea of a Catholic, fraternal benefit society. In an era when parish clubs and fraternal societies had wide popular appeal, the young priest felt there should be some way to strengthen religious faith and at the same time provide for the financial needs of families overwhelmed by illness or death of the breadwinner. He discussed this concept with Bishop Lawrence McMahon of Hartford, and received his approval. He traveled to Boston to talk with the Massachusetts Catholic Order of Foresters, and traveled to Brooklyn to consult the Catholic Benevolent Legion. He met with other priests of the diocese. Wherever he could, he sought information that would help the Catholic laymen to organize themselves into a benefit society. William Geary, one of the Order's charter members, said that at the first council meeting in 1882, he was \"acclaimed as founder by 24 men with hearts full of joy and thanksgiving, recognizing that without his optimism, his will to succeed, his counsel and advice they would have failed.\" Father McGivney had suggested Sons of Columbus as a name for the Order. This would bind Catholicism and Americanism together through the faith and bold vision of the New World's discoverer. The word \"knights\" replaced \"sons\" because key members of the organizing group who were Irish-born Civil War veterans felt it would help to apply a noble ritual in support of the emerging cause of Catholic civil liberty. In the first public reference to the Order on February 8, 1882, the New Haven Morning Journal and Courier said the Knights of Columbus' initial meeting had been held the night before. On March 29, the Connecticut legislature granted a charter to the Knights of Columbus, formally establishing it as a legal corporation. The Order's principles in 1882 were \"Unity\" and \"Charity.\" The concepts of \"Fraternity\" and \"Patriotism\" were added later. Each of these ideals played a major role in ceremonials from the beginning. The Columbus-linked themes, says historian Christopher J. Kauffman, \"reverberated with pride in the American promise of liberty, equality and opportunity.\" In April of 1882, Father McGivney, with the permission of Bishop McMahon, wrote to all the pastors of the Diocese of Hartford. The Order's primary objective, he wrote, was to dissuade Catholics from joining secret societies by providing them better advantages at times of death or sickness. He urged each pastor to exert influence \"in the formation of a Council in your parish.\" Father McGivney personally installed the first officers of San Salvador Council No. 1 in New Haven, in May of 1882. By May 1883, Council No. 2 had been instituted in Meriden, Connecticut and Bishop McMahon, so impressed with the organization, became a member of Council No. 11 in 1884, and served it as council chaplain. By the end of 1885, there were 31 councils in Connecticut. Father McGivney's dedication to the Order was evidenced in trips he made to all parts of Connecticut and in handwritten correspondence\u2014little of which survives\u2014about K of C business. At St. Mary's, despite all this, he remained the energetic curate with constant concern for every parishioner's problems. Then in November of 1884, he was named pastor of St. Thomas Church in Thomaston, Connecticut, a factory town 10 miles from his hometown. It was a factory parish, heavily in debt, serving working-class parishioners with few resources beyond their faith. With prayerful acceptance, Father McGivney put his seven years at St. Mary's behind him. His New Haven parishioners, in a testimonial resolution elaborately superimposed on the drawing of a chalice and host, declared that despite burdens and afflictions, his courtesy, his kindness and the purity of his life had \"secured the love and confidence of the people of St. Mary's, which will follow him in every future field of labor.\" In six subsequent years at St. Thomas, he wrestled with the church debt and built the same close ties of devotion and charitable concern he had developed in New Haven. He continued, as well, to serve as supreme chaplain, personally involved in helping the Order to extend its membership into Rhode Island. Later, from 1901 to 1939, his younger brothers, Msgrs. Patrick and John J. McGivney, served the Order as supreme chaplains. Never robust in health, Father McGivney was suddenly stricken with a serious case of pneumonia in January 1890. It hung on. Various treatments for consumptive illness were tried, but his decline persisted. The young priest lost physical strength just as the Order he founded was moving toward new vitality. On August 14, 1890, Father Michael J. McGivney died at the age of 38. In his 13 brief, busy years as a priest, Father McGivney's piety and compassion had won the love of those he served as curate and pastor. His Christian inspiration, leadership and administrative drive had brought him the loyalty and affection of thousands who knew him as the founder of the Knights of Columbus",

His goal was to teach residents how to help themselves, so that immigrants could create a fruitful, sustainable, and equitable livelihood. In 1998, the federally financed Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone provided his organization with a $750,000 revolving loan to fund commercial development within Community Board 12.

There was a bullet in me trying to take my life, all 13 years of it.\" He ran and the readers ran with him. The book has sold more than four million copies. The '60s were a turbulent decade. By 1965, the civil rights bill had been passed. Yet a new calamity of crime and riots was erupting in America's cities. Young black males were becoming a new urban menace in the public eye. Brown painted a new American archetype: An urban Huck Finn with a black face fighting and hustling his way through dark, trash-filled canyons of American dreams. Brown's Harlem was so brutal that his buddies could throw another kid off a roof and run away before the body hit the ground. His journey is marked by cold steel-- guns, knives, needles-- and vehicles that take him, not once, but several times to reform schools. Yet, despite his violent life, Brown's Manchild found redemption. He straightened out, went to college, attended law school, and wrote a best-seller. He dedicated his book to Eleanor Roosevelt, who founded the Wiltwyck School for boys in upstate New York, and to the Wiltwyck School, \"which is still finding Claude Browns,\" he said. If Claude Brown could be redeemed, he was trying to say, so could others. All they needed, it appeared, was someone who cared. Claude Brown's story seemed to both define and defy the culture of poverty argument that Oscar Lewis made popular in the 1960s and 1970s with his studies of poor Latino families. Poverty creates a debilitating culture, Lewis argued, one that the poor cannot lose even if they ceased to be poor. By the 1980s, the culture of poverty image seemed to prevail. Ronald Reagan advanced welfare reform to break the \"cycle of poverty,\" they said, for the \"urban underclass,\" a new label for the long-term poor, particularly black Americans left behind by the civil rights revolution. Even Claude Brown grew dismayed with the worsening condition of the young gangsters and delinquents he came to know in the new hip-hop generation. His generation had it bad, he said, but this new one, in an era of drive-by shootings and crack cocaine, seemed worse off, even more tragically devoid of hope. Claude Brown died in February of a lung condition. He was 64. He never wrote another best- seller, and poverty seems to have a new face in the age of welfare reform: The working poor, trying to make ends meet, trying to raise their kids with wages too low to lift them out of poverty. Others have fallen between the cracks, off the welfare rolls, but not onto anyone's payrolls. The poor, it seems, are becoming invisible again. Yet, as Brown wrote, there are more Claude Browns out there, still trying to reach the promised land.",

He won the World Heavyweight Boxing championship three times, and won the North American Boxing Federation championship as well as an Olympic gold medal. He was born in Louisville, Kentucky and was named after his father, Cassius Marcellus Clay, Sr., but later changed his name after joining the Nation of Islam and subsequently converted to Sunni Islam in 1975. In Louisville, October 29, 1960, he won his first professional fight winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker, who was the police chief of Fayetteville, West Virginia. He went on to later retire with a boxing record of 61 bouts with 56 wins (37 KOs), 5 losses (1 Kos) and 0 draws fighting some of the most exciting bouts in boxing history. In 1964, Ali failed the Armed Forces qualifying test because his writing and spelling skills were subpar, however, in early 1966, the tests were revised and Ali was reclassified 1A. He refused to serve in the United States Army during the Vietnam War as a conscientious objector. This and his affiliation with the Nation of Islam made him a controversial and popular figure in history. Near the end of 1967, he was stripped of his title by the professional boxing commission and would not be allowed to fight professionally for more than three years. He was also convicted for refusing induction into the army and sentenced to five years in prison. In 1970, he was allowed to fight again, and in late 1971 the Supreme Court reversed his conviction. He went on to fight Joe Frazer and George Foreman in what is arguably considered some of the best fights in boxing history. He was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease in the early 1980s causing his motor functions to decline. Despite his disability, he remained a beloved and active public figure. In 1985, he served as a guest referee at the inaugural WrestleMania event. In 1987, he was selected by the California Bicentennial Foundation for the U.S. Constitution to personify the vitality of the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights in various high profile activities and rode on a float at the 1988 Tournament of Roses Parade, launching the United States Constitution\u2019s 200th birthday commemoration. He received a Spirit of America Award calling him the most recognized American in the world and in 1996, he had the honor of lighting the flame at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1999, he received a special one-off award from the BBC at its annual BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award ceremony, which was the BBC Sports Personality of the Century Award. He was also named \u201cKentucky Athlete of the Century\u201d by the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame in ceremonies at the Galt House East. In 2005, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a White House ceremony on and the prestigious Otto Hahn peace medal in Gold of the United Nations Association of Germany in Berlin for his work with the US civil rights movement and the United Nations. On November 19, 2005, the $60 million non-profit Muhammad Ali Center opened in downtown Louisville, Kentucky. In addition to displaying his boxing memorabilia, the center focuses on core themes of peace, social responsibility, respect, and personal growth. After his retirement from boxing, he was devoted to humanitarian endeavors around the world lending his name and presence to hunger and poverty relief, supporting education efforts of all kinds, promoting adoption and encouraging people to respect and better understand one another. It is estimated that he has helped to provide more than 22 million meals to feed the hungry.",

    "reason": "King Stephen was born Vajk, in 977 AD, son of Grand Prince Geza of the Magyars. Dedicated to the welfare of his people and committed to the strengthening of his people through intellectual and moral means, Geza invited Christian missionaries of the reform Benedictines from Cluny, France into his realm. As an example to his people, he had missionaries instruct his son and baptize him under the name Istvan or Stephen. Stephen succeeded his father as Grand Prince of the Magyars in 997. Recognizing the energetic and responsible leadership of this young ruler on the eastern flank of Europe, Pope Sylvester II in 1000 granted Stephen the title of King of Hungary and sent papal emissaries to him with a crown symbolic of the new title and a double barred archbishop\u2019s cross indicative of the establishment of a separate church organization for the newly independent nation. Since then, this crown and cross have become the radical confirmation of legitimate constitutional authority in Hungary and a rallying symbol of national identity and strength during the occupations of the Turks, the Austrians, the Nazis and the Soviets. The coronation of Stephen also focused Hungary toward the west. Stephen organized the secular and religious life of Hungary in a manner which endures, with slight change, to the present. He invited foreigners, especially those who were refugees from oppression, into Hungary so that they could each enrich it with their customs, languages, and creativity. In this fashion, Stephen anticipated the \u201cmelting pot\u201d concept of society, as we know it today. In his personal life, Stephen lived as an outstanding example of a husband and a father to such a extent that he and his son Prince Imre, or Emeric, were recognized as Catholic saints, and his wife, Queen Gesilla, was recognized as a Catholic blessed. Outstanding for his service to the poor and destitute and stalwart in using his political power for the defense of the powerless, Stephen shortly before he died, officially offered his crown to God as the only true ruler. December 20, 2000 marked the millennium of the coronation of Stephen as the first monarch of the Magyars (Hungarians). In recognition of this event, Pastors of the Hungarian churches of New York City have requested the permanent renaming of East 82nd Street, between York Avenue and Third Avenue, to \u201cKing Stephen of Hungary Way\u201d.

He was baptized at an early age into the fellowship of the Elizabeth Baptist Church in Arcadia, Florida. Mr. Gardner received his elementary education in the public schools of Arcadia and later graduated from Morehouse Academy in 1927. In June 1931, he was graduated from Morehouse College, with an A.B. degree, where he had an outstanding record as both an athlete and a scholar. In 1949, Mr. Gardner received a BD degree from Virginia University and in 1965 he was awarded a Doctor of Divinity degree from Virginia Union University. Mr. Gardner also studied at Drew University, Columbia University\u2019s Teachers College and Union Theological Seminary. In 1936 he married Bessie Faust and they had two children Dr. William E Gardner 2nd, and Zenobia Gardner Earl. During the years 1942 to 1945 Reverend Gardner served in the United States Army as a chaplain, attaining the rank of Captain. After completing college, Reverend Gardner was a High School Principal for five years in several cities in Florida. He was also the Minister of First Baptist Church, Arcadia, Florida, Harmony Baptist Church, Lakeland, Florida and First Baptist Church in Williamsburg, Virginia. In 1950 he assumed the pastorate of First Baptist Church, East Elmhurst, New York. During his tenure as pastor of First Baptist the membership grew from less than 200 to over 2,200 members. A beautiful new church costing more than half a million dollars was built. Reverend Gardner served his church and his community in many capacities during his lifetime. He was a past president of the Baptist Ministers Conference of Greater New York and Vicinity, a member of the Advisory Committee of the local N.A.A.C.P., Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Baptist Educational Center of Brooklyn and Long Island, and he was the New York representative on the Ministerial Benefit Board of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A., Inc. Also among Reverend Gardner\u2019s accomplishments was his selection as \u201cDistinguished Institute Leader and Preacher\u201d at Virginia Union University and Bishop College and his selection in 1973 as Alumni of the Year by Virginia Union University. Reverend Gardner served as a member of the 250th Anniversary Committee of Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia and published several articles on the Negro in Colonial times. Reverend Doctor William E. Gardner, Sr. died in June 1974. He was survived by his wife, Mrs. Bessie F. Gardner; his son and daughter, and two grandchildren. In recognition of his many years of devoted service to his church and to the community of Queens, it is fitting that 31st Avenue, between 100th and 101st Streets in East Elmhurst, the site of his beloved First Baptist Church, be named \u201cRev. William E. Gardner Place\u201d in his honor.",

    "reason": "Reverend Frederic Sutter and Reverend Carl Sutter were a father and son team that helped to guide the fortunes of the Trinity Lutheran Church at the Stapleton community of Staten Island for more than 71 years. Reverend Frederic Sutter, one of the first graduates of Wagner College (Rochester, NY), became pastor of Trinity Lutheran Church in 1907. Shortly after his arrival, the congregation decided that a new church was needed. The responsibility of building the new church fell to Reverend Sutter. He guided the project into construction in 1913 and in 1914, the present edifice, an imposing Gothic structure of yellow brick located on Beach Street, was dedicated. Trinity Lutheran Church grew under Reverend Sutter\u2019s leadership and by 1929 was believed to have 3,000 baptized members and 1100 communing members and probably had the largest Protestant membership on Staten Island at that time. Near the end of World War I, Reverend Sutter\u2019s alma mater, Wagner College in Rochester, New York, reached out to him for help finding a new location for the school. Through his efforts, Wagner College relocated to Grymes Hill on Staten Island. Reverend Frederic Sutter was succeeded as pastor at Trinity Lutheran Church in 1964 by his son, Reverend Carl Sutter, who had served under him for more than three decades. Rev. Carl Sutter, known as \u201cPastor Carl\u201d, was born in Hudson, New York and was brought to Staten Island, at seven months of age, when his father accepted the pastorate at Trinity Lutheran Church. He attended Public Schools 14 and 15 in Tompkinsville and Wagner Preparatory School. In 1929 he received a Bachelor\u2019s degree in liberal arts from Wagner College. Carl Sutter then took a job on Wall Street while continuing his education at New York University Graduate School. After the stock market crashed later that year, Carl Sutter decided to leave the business world and follow in his father\u2019s footsteps in the ministry. He enrolled at Princeton University and, a year later, transferred to his father\u2019s alma mater, Lutheran Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. Soon after his ordination in 1933 he returned to Staten Island to join his father at Trinity Lutheran Church. He was to spend his entire career as a clergyman there. In 1936, Dr. Sutter married his childhood sweetheart, the former Eleanor Koehler of Stapleton and moved to Emerson Hill. Rev. Sutter was considered by many as a pioneer in improving community relations on Staten Island. He helped organize the Booker T. Washington Center during World War II to look after the needs of some 7000 African-American troops stationed in Stapleton who were denied access to the local United Service Organization (USO). Also during the War, Rev. Sutter, who was fluent in German, served as the chaplain for German prisoners of war at the former Halloran Hospital. He often played a key role in the Staten Island Interfaith relations, having served as chairman of the building committee for The nondenominational Bethel Community Church in Tompkinsville. Also, for several years, he orchestrated a series of Holy Week Services that brought together members of Protestant and Catholic churches in the Stapleton/Tompkinsville community. Rev. Sutter served as president of the Staten Island Council of Churches and held a key position in what is now the Metropolitan Synod of the Lutheran Church of America. During the 1960\u2019s, Rev. Sutter oversaw the construction of the $1,000,000 Trinity Lutheran School. He delayed his retirement seven years, until 1978, to ensure that the debt on the school was paid in full. Reverend Carl Sutter died in October 1998 at the age of 91. He was survived by two sons, Frederic and Carl Richard, three grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. Staten Island County Clerk Mario J. Esposito, who served on the Wagner College Board of Trustees with Reverend Carl Sutter for 12 years, said in an interview that he considered Reverend Frederic Sutter and Reverend Carl Sutter the \u201cbackbone\u201d of the College. \u201cBoth were friendly, community-minded. They set the standards and the goals. They were men of integrity.\u201d In recognition of their contributions to Wagner College, Trinity Lutheran Church, the Borough of Staten Island and the City of New York, it is fitting that the northeast corner of Beach Street and St. Paul\u2018s Avenue, the site of Trinity Lutheran Church, be named \u201cRev. Frederic and Rev. Carl Sutter Corner\u201d in their honor.",

He was raised in the Dongan Hills section of Staten Island, attended Public School 11 and graduated from New Dorp High School in 1942. As a child, Mr. Candrilli was always active in sports, playing baseball for New Dorp High School, football in the New Dorp Teens Football League and caddying at the Richmond County Country Club, which brought out his love for golf. On October 22, 1942 Sal Candrilli enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and served as a Combat Engineer in the 2nd Division, seeing action in Spain, the Mariana Islands and Okinawa. He was honorably discharged as a Corporal on December 8, 1945. After his discharge, Sal Candrilli worked for the Great Lakes Dredge and Dock Company and for Local 21, Staten Island before being hired by the New York City Department of Parks, where he retired after 35 years as a Mechanic Foreman in 1985. He met and married, Ethel Young on April 10, 1948 and they had four children, Donald, Richard, Jerome and Missey, which is why his \u201clove affair\u201d of approximately 30 years, with Little League Baseball started. Sal Candrilli began his Little League \u201ccareer\u201d as a coach with the Island Chevies. He also served as field Commissioner, umpire, and later, president of the Staten Island Little League in Dongan Hills, for approximately 17 years. He continued for another 13 years as District 24 Administrator for the National Little League Headquarters, overseeing leagues on Staten Island and in Manhattan. During this time he led the fight against a measure that would have taxed Little Leagues for their real estate helping to form the Staten Island Athletic and Recreational Alliance. He also was a pioneer in creating night baseball on Staten Island and a girl\u2019s softball program. A ball field was named for him by the Staten Island Little League. In May of 1973, the Award of Merit was presented to Mr. Candrilli from then Borough President of Richmond, Robert T. Connor. In 1974, while president of the Staten Island Little League, he was profiled in the Staten Island Advance for his work in planning and preparing to host the National Regional Tournament at Hy Turkin field. In 1976, he was honored for \u201cOutstanding Services to Staten Island Sports\u201d, at the 11th annual Advance All-Star Dinner. In 1985 Mr. Candrilli decided to \u201cretire\u201d from Little League Baseball because, as he said, \u201ctimes have changed and it\u2019s time for someone else to take over\u201d, but also saying that, \u201cI\u2019ll always be around\u201d. On September 20, 1996 Salvatore Candrilli died. He was survived by his wife, the former Ethel Young; his children, a sister, Ann Pinto, and four grandchildren. His participation in organized sports on Staten Island made a difference for many people, including his grandchildren, Christina and Peter Candrilli and Nicole and Jennifer Vitagliano, who actively play in many organized sports on Staten Island. They have inherited his sportsmanship, respect for others on and off the field, and his true feelings for all kinds of sports, always remembering that he would say \u201cit doesn\u2019t make a difference if you win or lose but it\u2019s how you play the game\u201d.

A year later Mr. Rapkin was elected Junior Vice-President of the organization and in 1977 he was elected Commander and was re-elected Commander n 1978. Shortly after joining Post #769, Mr. Rapkin suggested that the organization donate money to the Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Association of New York to purchase two bullet-proof vests. This was done at a time when the New York City Police Department did not issue bulletproof vests. Mr. Rapkin also involved Post #769 in many other projects. In 1977, JWV sponsored the dedication of a \u2018Lt. Colonel Yehonatan Netanyahu Lane\u2019, in the Pelham Parkway area, in memory of the Israeli hero who was killed in the Entebbe raid in Uganda. In 1986, the crosswalk at Pelham Parkway South and Muliner Avenue was named the \u2018Raoul Wallenberg Lane\u2019 in memory of a Swedish diplomat who saved thousands of Jews from Nazi death camps. In 1995, Mr. Rapkin was the driving force in getting a permanent street sign identifying the corner of Pelham Parkway South and Cruger Avenue as \u2018Jewish War Veterans of the USA and Ladies Auxiliary Lane\u2019. Also in 1995, Mr. Rapkin sponsored a sizable donation to the Kingsbridge Veterans Hospital to purchase a V-Tech Computer for disabled veterans in the Spinal Column Ward, and was mainly responsible for the erection of a beautiful monument \u201cIn memory of all American Jewish men and women who made the supreme sacrifice in the defense of the USA.\u201d The monument was placed on the front lawn of Bronx House on Pelham Parkway South.

    "reason": "Juan Pablo Duarte, born in the city of Santo Domingo on January 26, 1813, is considered the \u201cFounding Father of the Dominican Republic\u201d. He was the son of a Spanish merchant and, as a teenager, he was sent to Spain to continue his studies. During this time he was greatly influenced by Catalonia\u2019s \u201cautonomous community\u201d goals. When he returned to Santo Domingo in 1838, he found that young Dominicans were resentful of Haitian rule. The Haitian domination of eastern portion of the island of Hispaniola had begun in 1822. The political unification of Hispaniola brought liberation to the slaves, land reforms, and political rights for all the people living on the eastern part of the island. Haitian domination made the Dominican people recognize the importance of self-government and political participation. Haitian law recognized political participation but Dominicans were actually considered a minority with few rights. Is was in this atmosphere that Juan Pablo Duarte created a secret society, called \u201cLa Trinitaria\u201d, in 1838 so that the yearning for liberty and self-government could be further intensified. He developed a political underground movement that organized the youth of the most important cities of the eastern part of Hispaniola. To promote their goals they used flyers, \u201ccantaletas\u201d (serenades with songs that had political content), and presented dramas with political content through a cultural organization called \u201cLa Filantropica\u201d. This organization was open to all, promoted cultural activities and was controlled by \u201cLa Trinitaria\u201d. In 1843, La Trinitaria worked together with the \u201cReformista\u201d movement from the western part of the island to overthrow Jean Pierre Boyer\u2019s Regime. Though this did not end Haitian rule, the situation made it possible for the La Trinitaria movement to gain political strength and to work in the open during elections. Charles Herard, the leader of the Reformista movement and successor to Boyer, understood and mistrusted the political goals of the Trinitaria. After he was elected president in 1843 Herard persecuted the \u201cLa Trinitaria\u201d movement and Duarte was forced to escape to Curacaco while his closest collaborators went into hiding. However, the movement toward independence continued to grow even with Duarte in exile. On February 27, 1844 the forces for independence issued a proclamation declaring the freedom of the Dominican Republic. Duarte returned and he immediately took charge of the army. This situation was short lived, however, for another political group that also promoted annexation took over the government and jailed Duarte. He was sent into exile within a year. Duarte retired to an isolated village in Venezuela and remained away from his country for twenty years. In 1861, Spain took over the Dominican Republic and made it a colony. War broke out in 1863 against Spanish rule and Duarte returned the following year to fight again for Dominican Independence. He was sent on a diplomatic mission by the provisional Dominican government to solicit funding for the war from neighboring countries. After independence was reestablished he returned to Venezuela. He died there in 1876, having devoted his entire life to the independence of the Dominican Republic. In recognition of his leadership in the independence movement of his country it is fitting that the northern side of West 170th Street, between Saint Nicholas Avenue and Broadway, in the heart of one of New York\u2019s largest Dominican communities, be called \u201cJuan Pablo Duarte Square.\u201d The naming of this \u201cSquare\u201d, located at the end of the previously named \u201cJuan Pablo Duarte Boulevard\u201d, will provide space to erect a monument to Duarte as a symbol of \u201cdemocracy and freedom\u201d.",

    "reason": "Jean-Jacques Dessalines is one of the founding fathers of Haiti, having taken charge of the Haitian Revolution to victory in defeating the French Napoleon Army in 1804. Significant to world history, the Haitian Revolution is not only the first and only successful slave revolution in the Americas, but also resulted in Haiti being the first Latin American country and second in the Western Hemisphere to declare its independence, after the United States declared independence from Britain in 1776. Furthermore, the Haitian Revolution was inspirational and gave support to the enslaved and subjugated peoples throughout the world. More significantly, the Haitian Revolution was a truly transcultural event, joining three interlocking and intersectional 18th Century struggles, which continue to reverberate to the present: the challenge to imperial European authority; the fight for racial equality and the movement to end to slavery. Jean-Jacques Dessalines was born into slavery in the French colony of Saint-Domingue. In 1791, he joined the fight for freedom when thousands of brutally exploited enslaved people rose up against their colonial masters, and their enablers in France, who murdered and massacred hundreds of thousands of people across the Caribbean. By 1793, he was fighting under General Toussaint Louverture, earning the nickname \u201cthe Tiger\u201d for his intensity in battle and his military skill. Within a few years, the slave insurgents forced the French administrators of the colony to emancipate them, a decision ratified by revolutionary Paris in 1794. From 1794 through 1802, Dessalines fought with Louverture both for and against France for the eradication of slavery and the self-determination of the people of Saint-Domingue. After Louverture was kidnapped, shackled and deported to France in 1802, Dessalines led the Revolution, as Napoleon appointed General Rochambeau to lead the French military expedition to re-conquer Saint-Domingue. Rochambeau immediately embarked on a massacre of much of the non-white civilians, including women and children, and military population by staging mass executions via firing squads, hanging and drowning. By January 1, 1804, the French were defeated and Dessalines declared Haiti independent. Between February and April 1804, Dessalines, in response to French brutality and out of fear of future French re-conquest and re-enslavement ordered the execution of all the remaining white French on the island, estimated in the range of 3,000 to 5,000, but personally protected whites loyal to Haitian independence, including thousands of Polish soldiers who had defected from the French Army. The Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) became the first slave revolt in modern history to result in an independent nation. The independence of Haiti reshaped the Atlantic world by leading to the French sale of Louisiana to the United States, and encouraged republican revolutions in Latin America, and eventually Africa. Under Petion, Haiti provided direct assistance to Simon Bolivar on at least two crucial occasions during the latter\u2019s successful efforts to secure independence for the Spanish Colonial territories throughout Latin America. Dessalines was declared Emperor of Haiti in September 1804. Many of the policies he implemented were progressive even by today\u2019s standards, including social policies, such as freedom of religion, equal rights for children born out of wedlock, marriage and divorce laws favorable to women. Dessalines also attempted land reforms, and specifically policies to address the concentration of ownership of valuable plantations throughout the country by a few wealthy families, which likely led to his death in a roadside ambush on October 17, 1806, when those who opposed his economic policies rebelled and took up arms against him. Jean-Jacques Dessalines remains a popular symbol of Haitian nationalism. The first capital of independent Haiti was renamed \u201cDessalines\u201d; the national anthem of Haiti is named after him (\u201cLa Dessalinienne\u201d); and his image appears on the 250 Haitian gourde note.",

Jacob Safra was the proprietor of Banque de Credit National, successor to the business of Safra Freres, a merchant banking business that originated about 1840 in the Ottoman Empire.In 1948 Edmond was sent, along with an experienced banker, to Italy to consider diversification opportunities for the family. The post war atmosphere was filled with opportunities for an energetic, entrepreneurial banker and Edmond created a precious metals trading business, the first of what was to become a long string of financial and banking successes.In 1952 Edmond was encouraged by his father to explore opportunities in the New World. Having visited North and South America he decided to open a business in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Within a few years progress was so substantial that Edmund persuaded his father to move the rest of the family to Brazil. The Brazilian business evolved into Banco Safra, which is now Brazil's fifth largest bank. Today, Edmond\u2019s two younger brothers privately own it.In 1956 Edmond opened the predecessor to Trade Development Bank in Geneva, Switzerland. He wanted to meet the international financial and banking needs of middle eastern families which, like his own were moving from that troubled region. In 1983 Trade Development Bank was sold to the American Express Company for $550 million.In the early 1960's Edmond decided to complete the South American European banking triangle and applied for a national banking charter in New York City. The charter was granted and Republic National Bank of New York was opened in January, 1996. Its initial capital, which was slightly more than $10 million, was at the time the largest initial capitalization of a new bank in the history of the United States. The ribbon was cut by Robert Kennedy. Edmond never forgot that Robert Kennedy helped him, and after Bobby's tragic death Edmond created The Robert F. Kennedy Chair in Latin American Studies at Harvard University.Republic became one of America's most successful banks. Through merchandise promotions and acquisitions, it became a leading retail bank with more than one million accounts, while simultaneously developing the world's leading gold trading business. In 1999, Republic and its European affiliate, Safra Republic Holdings, SA, were sold to HSBC, PLC for approximately $10 billion.Shortly before his tragic death in 1999, Mr. Safra formed the Edmund J. Safra Philanthropic Foundation, to carry forward his philanthropic mission. His foundation, with the guidance and support of his wife, Lily, has honored his memory in many ways: by creating The Edmond J. Safra Hall at The Museum of Jewish Heritage; The Edmond J.

    "reason": "The following biographical material was provided by \u201cThe Violin: The Multimedia Encyclopedia.\u201d Isaac stern was born in Kremenetz, Ukraine, on July 21, 1920. His family traveled to the United States when he was one year old and settled in San Francisco. His mother, a professional singer, trained him in music and at age 7 first began learning the piano, then the violin at age 9. He later studied for 3 years with Robert Pollack and for a few months with Louis Persinger. He also studied until age 15 with Nahum Blinder, whom he considered his only true teacher. He was later to say : \u201cHe taught me how to learn by myself, which is the most important thing a teacher can teach you.\u201d From this time on, Isaac stern became very interested in chamber music, already playing quartets and quintets with the principals of the San Francisco Orchestra. At age 15, he performed J. S. Bach's Double Concerto on stage with his teacher. The following year, in 1936, he played a Brahms concerto with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra under Pierre Monteux, then a Tchaikovsky concerto in Los Angeles under Otto Klemperer. On October 11, 1937, he made his New York debut at Carnegie Hall, and appeared again in February 1939. This new public appearance was hailed by enthusiastic critics, placing him at the forefront of musicians of his generation. During World War II, he gave many concerts for the Armed Forces.In January 1943, Isaac Stern gave his first Carnegie Hall recital. The following year, he appeared twice with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Dimitri Mitropoulos. In 1945, he made his first recordings for Columbia Records, and the following year, he was chosen by Hollywood to double the violin parts for the actor John Garfield in the movie \u201cHumoresque.\u201d Thereafter, he went on to play with the greatest conductors, Sir Thomas Beecham, Dimitri Mitropoulos, Bruno Walter, Eugene Ormandy, Leonard Bernstein and George Szell. He played the part of Eug\u00e8ne Ysa\u00ffe in the film \u201cTonight We Sing,\u201d relating the life of the great impresario Sol Hurok. In 1948, he made his European debut at the Lucerne Festival, and in 1950, he took part in the first Prades Festival, organized with Pablo Casals by Alexander Schneider to celebrate the 200th anniversary of J. S. Bach's death. He again appeared with Casals during the following years in Perpignan and Prades, and a few years later at the Puerto Rico Festival. His meeting with the famous cellist was a determinant influence and led him to devote part of his activity to chamber music, with Eugene Istomin, Alexander Schneider, William Primrose or Paul Tortelier. In the early 1960s, he organized a trio with Eugene Istomin and Leonard Rose, which became extremely successful and toured widely until Rose's death in 1984. In 1956, during the cold war, he was also one of the first United States musicians to tour widely in the USSR. On the other hand, he always refused to play in Germany, in memory of the atrocities committed under Nazi rule. He had very strong ties with the State of Israel and collaborated assiduously with Israeli-American cultural centers and foundations, providing advice and support to young musicians in that country. He played an important role as a pedagogue and mentor for such young Israeli virtuosi as Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zukerman, Myriam Fried, Sergiu Luca and Shlomo Mintz.In addition to his activity as a violinist, Isaac Stern participated intensively in American musical life, making important contributions as music director for the National Council for the Arts. After 1960, he was Chairman of Carnegie Hall, that prestigious concert hall which, with others, he saved from demolition. In 1979, he made a trip to China, and the film relating this event, \u201cFrom Mao to Mozart\u201d was awarded an Oscar from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1981. Many contemporary works were composed for Isaac Stern, including William Schuman's Concerto in 1950, Leonard Bernstein's Serenade in 1954, George Rochberg's Concerto in 1975, Penderecki's Concerto No. 1 in 1977, Dutilleux's Concerto in 1985 and Maxwell Davies\u2019 Concerto in 1986. In 1987, Isaac Stern formed a new trio with Yo Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax, which performed and recorded in the company of such artists as Jaime Laredo and Cho-Liang Lin. A symbol of American violin playing for over 50 years, he was also one of the greatest 20th century masters. Isaac Stern died on September 22, 2001.",

    "reason": "Marion Castellano was born on September 5, 1925 in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. By the time she reached her eleventh birthday her father had passed away from pneumonia. She began cleaning apartments at age eleven to help her family make ends meet and became a forewoman in a dress factory at age seventeen. Marion learned responsibility at an early age and she became the secondary income to her mother as the middle child of three girls. Being an adept seamstress from her years in the factory, Marion would donate clothing she made to the poorer families from her church, Our Lady of Solace. When her parish's school was unable to afford desperately needed maintenance, Marion organized fundraisers and bake sales to assist them in reaching their goals. During World War II, she worked making army field jackets to help in the war effort and became politically and socially aware during that turbulent time. Marion married in 1946 and she and her husband raised three children, living behind a candy store, which they opened on Bath Avenue in the late 1950\u2019s. As a small candy store owner, working seven days a week, Marion still found the time to become manager for the local little league team. Marion's community awareness expanded to the political arena in the 1960's when she became Captain of the 16th Republican Assembly District of Kings County. She was also a Kings County committeewoman and worked as a troubleshooter during elections for her district. In 1965, being the natural organizer that she was, Marion began the Cropsey Park Concert Series, which drew thousands for free rock music events. Speeches by Abe Stark, Louis Lefkowitz and Dizzy Gillespie, became commonplace. To this day, these concerts are still being enjoyed each summer at the park. In 1967, she and her husband Phil opened up Bath Music, located in Bensonhurst, which she operated until her passing. Marion became the heart of the music scene in her community. She would open at any hour to help a musician in need. She tried to instill the strong ethics she had into them. She worked through many troubled times with them, helping many to get help for their drug or alcohol addictions. Mama and Papa, as she and her husband were commonly known, also donated instruments to local schools, churches, charitable organizations, and even to the police marching band. Although she was kind, she was not a pushover. Standing just 4\u201911\u201d, she disarmed a 6\u20191\u201d bandit who had come to rob her, by knocking the gun out of his hand and kicking him to the ground. This was chronicled in several local papers.Marion kept a community bulletin board in her store and would refer people in need to the proper City agency. Children particularly moved her. Any child in need became one of hers. She helped to reunite a runaway, who was in a cult, with her parents. She worked personally with mentally and emotionally challenged children from the neighborhood. She worked to get them benefits, to have them removed from abusive households, and get them settled in community homes, or in some instances, apartments of their own. She helped Chin and Leroy Chow for over 25 years, after their families abandoned them. She was a lifesaver, literally. A woman passing the store started screaming and panicking when she saw that her infant child had choked, stopped breathing, and was starting to turn blue. Marion rushed to the carriage grabbed the baby by her feet and whacked her on the back, dislodging the blockage. In countless cases, either running to help people in accidents on her busy avenue, assisting people fallen from epilepsy, or just coming to the aid of those who could not help themselves, Marion knew the solution to each problem was to get involved.Marion Castellano died on March 1, 2000. Over a thousand people attended her wake and flowers overflowed four rooms and wrapped around the foyer of the funeral parlor. The wake had to be extended an extra day and the funeral director at Miraglia Chapels exclaimed that in his thirty years he had never seen such an overwhelming amount of respect. She was selfless throughout her life, and never looked for acknowledgement for her countless good deeds. She was the backbone of her community.",

Lobbia\u2019s journalism \u2013 and its incredible advocacy for the rights of tenants all over New York City \u2013 has had an immeasurable impact on our City. It is for this lifetime of accomplishment that Manhattan Community Board No. 5 has approved naming a stretch of the bike lane on Sixth Avenue in her honor.When J.A. Lobbia went to work, she put her heart and soul into it. Her \u201cTowers and Tenements\u201d column covered the City\u2019s affordable housing crisis, the State\u2019s weakening of rent regulation laws, the strident efforts of the tenants\u2019 movements, and exposed the shameful ways of certain slumlords and developers. A true sign that someone really cares about an issue is his or her dedication, even after the workday is done. When J.A. Lobbia would be biking through neighborhoods, she would take notice eviction notices and stop to give advice if she could. She even noticed an eviction notice written in Chinese, had it translated so that she could read it, wrote a response, had it translated back into Chinese, and slipped it under the door. Also, she actively volunteered her time at the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, and as a tutor in the Immigrant Literacy Project of the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart.For her efforts and diligent dedication to journalism, Lobbia received many awards. Among these are the 2001 Front Page Award from the Newswomen\u2019s Club of NY, Scales of Justice Media Award from Mobilization for Youth Legal Services, Best Columnist Award from the Society of Professional Journalism, and a Golden Typewriter Award for Public Interest in Journalism.J.A.

She unfortunately died from cancer in 2001 at the young age of 43. Even throughout her illness, Lobbia continued to be out on the streets, getting stories and helping other people.Although known and admired by most for her work on tenants rights, J.A. Lobbia was involved in other issues. Among those were transportation and traffic, in that she was an avid cyclist. When she was sick, she was quoted as saying that when she died, she would want to be \u201cburied in a dress and bike shoes.\u201d For a person who gave so much to the tenants of New York City, there seems no better tribute than naming a bike lane in her honor.",

Even as the neighborhood changed, they would be major figures in their little area, serving to cement ties holding people together, until their tragic deaths.Leonard Walit, 72, was an accountant, an avid reader, a fan of history and a loving husband. He attended Lincoln High School, then Brooklyn College, followed by graduate courses at NYU. Together with his wife, Harriet, they served as the center of their neighborhood, transforming it into a pleasant oasis in an otherwise gritty part of Brooklyn. Although they had no children, they were often considered to be the \u201cmom and pop\u201d of the neighborhood by others, due to their incredibly open hearts, an unending desire to serve the common good and their warm and loving personalities.Harriet Walit, 66, was born and raised in Hazelton, Pennsylvania. After High School, Harriet attended Misericordia and Penn State Colleges, graduating with a Masters of Social Work degree. After marrying Leonard and moving to Boerum Hill, Mrs. Walit served on the board of Stepping Stone, a neighborhood halfway house, and volunteered with the Salvation Army.",

Paul received his education in a Catholic elementary school and public high school. At the age of 17, Paul\u2019s grandmother passed away, leaving him to arrange sleeping in relatives and friends homes. At one point, Paul stayed with Langston Hughes, where Paul Ramos learned about music and refined his taste in jazz and poetry.From 1960-1963, Paul worked at the Veterans Administration Hospital as an Operating Room Technician. In 1964 he began work as a trainer at a management-engineering firm. Because of his background in hospital work, he was assigned to monitor proprietary health institutions and related agencies that included nursing homes, private clinics and group practices. In 1965 he began working for several Lower East Side community organizations, where he counseled \u201cproblem children\u201d and obtained private funds for reading and tutoring programs. He educated parents in health care delivery and how to avail themselves of the resources in the community.In 1966 he accepted a position in the Community Development and Education Department of the Gouverneur Health Services Program. In this capacity, he monitored the delivery of health care to patients and organized a crisis intervention unit, focused on welfare, housing and relocation of families. Paul devoted the rest of his life to the nurturing and growth of what is today the Betances Health Center, located at 80 Henry Street. Paul Ramos worked tirelessly for over 30 years to promote health equity and to expand the quality of affordable health care for all in one of New York\u2019s most diverse and underserved neighborhoods, the Lower East Side.As an early and active supporter of patient advocacy, he initiated local changes, which improved health care for the disadvantaged. He developed the Betances Health Unit, a grassroots mobile health unit, into the state of the art community health care center. This center has emerged through his vision into a proto-type for community health, one that continues its commitment to culturally respectful, compassionate care.In the early 1980\u2019s, when HIV emerged, Paul\u2019s infinite wisdom and compassion led Betances to the forefront as one of the first community health centers to begin to provide ongoing counseling, treatment and primary care to those living with HIV and AIDS. For years, Paul was associated himself with the Lower East Side Task Force on AIDS, the Latino Commission on AIDS and the AIDS Service Center, of which he was the board chair until his untimely passing in May 2000.

Born Jeffrey Hyman on May 19, 1951 in Forest Hills, Queens, the gawky geek decked out in sunglasses and black leather would found the Ramones in 1974, with friends Johnny, Dee Dee and Tommy. Each adopted the surname Ramone, after a stage name (Ramon) used by Paul McCartney during the earliest Beatles days.Best known for such two-minute anthems as \u201cI Wanna Be Sedated,\u201d \u201cBlitzkrieg Bop\u201d \u201cRockaway Beach\u201d and \u201cTeenage Lobotomy,\u201d the Ramones are credited with founding what would later be dubbed \u201cpunk rock.\u201d According to legend, it was all an accident. Novices on their instruments, the quartet knew four chords and played them at breakneck speed to prevent listeners from discerning the mistakes. An average concert consisted of about three dozen songs in about 90 minutes. Punk caught on and found a home at the downtown Manhattan club CBGBs, where the Ramones performed with like-minded souls Richard Hell, Patti Smith and Television. After a Ramones tour in 1976, the genre spread to England, where the Sex Pistols and Damned copied what they saw but added a more rebellious edge.In 1979, the Ramones appeared in the Roger Corman movie Rock 'n' Roll High School, recording the title song for the soundtrack. Ten years later they contributed the title track to Pet Cemetery, based on the book by Stephen King. But mainstream crossover success consistently eluded them. Although their fiercely delivered, wincingly inane pop songs about social misfits were hailed as rock classics, none ever cracked the Top 40. The Ramones commercial profile consistently paled in comparison to each new generation of groups they inspired--from the Clash and Blondie, through the Offspring and Green Day (two of whose members named children after the Ramones) and now Blink-182 and Fenix TX.Over 22 years and several lineup changes the Ramones recorded 13 albums. They released their last, \u201cAdios Amigos,\u201d and broke up in 1996, after performing a farewell show \u2013 their 2,263rd \u2013 with guests including Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder and Soundgarden's Chris Cornell.Joey Ramone died of lymphatic cancer on April 15, 2001, which he had been battling for about seven years. He died in his hospital bed, and is said to have passed when U2\u2019s \u201cA Little While\u201d concluded. Not only was he the front man for his band, he was the front man of a generation of punk rockers. More than any of his contemporaries, Joey Ramone was the figurehead for the New York punk scene that spawned many favorite bands.",

Thereafter, Michelle went on to St. John\u2019s University where she pursued a Bachelor degree in Journalism. In addition to being an honor student, Michelle enjoyed a host of extracurricular activities. Michelle was a founding member of the Saint John\u2019s University chapter of Delta Sigma Theta sorority, and started an internship for print journalism students at the New York Voice Newspaper. Michelle also worked as an intern for NBC and CBS News. Upon graduating Cum Laude from St. John\u2019s University, Michelle took a position as a staff producer for Fox 5 News, under television personality Bill McCreary.Michelle\u2019s unending thirst for knowledge soon led her back to St. John\u2019s, where she earned a Masters Degree in Early Childhood Education. While studying for her degree, Michelle was appointed Educational Director of Middleton\u2019s Day Care center. There she was able to instill her love of learning into the hearts and souls of many young children. Her legal career began when she was awarded a scholarship to the prestigious Howard University School of Law. In the summer of her second year in law school, Michelle accepted a position as a criminal law intern with the United States Attorney\u2019s Office, under former United States Attorney Rudolph Guiliani.After graduating from Howard and passing the Bar examinations of four states, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morganthau appointed Michelle to the position of Assistant District Attorney for New York County. While working in the D.A.\u2019s office, Michelle met and married her friend and husband Lonnie H. Bond. In 1993 Michelle left the District Attorney\u2019s office to launch her own law firm along with her sister Cathy. Through her diligence, creativity and unyielding tenacity, the office was transformed from a tiny storefront to a major firm serving the Southeast Queens community. While there, Michelle opened the doors to her law firm and started an internship program for young high school students who had an interest in pursuing a career in law. Michelle occasionally left the confines of her office to speak with young people at high schools in the metropolitan area. She spoke about the importance of staying in school, and how they too could have a career in law if they were willing to study hard. Michelle served for many years on the board of United Children Appeal, a non-profit organization helping inner city children with remedial math and reading.Michelle taught a class two nights a week at York College in legal writing. In addition, she served as an arbitrator in Queens County Civil Court until her health prevented her from doing so.

A strong believer in education, Michelle did much volunteer work for the United Negro College fund.In 1993, Michelle was diagnosed with cancer. Despite painful surgeries, grueling treatments and frequent hospitalizations, she continued to build the law firm and be involved with the community. Michelle also turned her attention to fighting breast cancer. She was a dedicated member of the National Breast Cancer Coalition and lobbied on Capital Hill for increased government funding for cancer research.On July 10 1997, Michelle\u2019s fearless, bold and intrepid battle with cancer came to an end.

    "reason": "The following information is from the McClung Museum exhibition \u201cCartier: The Jewler\u2019s Art\u201d at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.Founded in 1847 in Paris by Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Cartier, the firm became one of the world's greatest designers and manufacturers of jewelry and objets d'art, and a supplier to royalty, nobility, and millionaires.Until the end of the 19th century, Cartier was primarily a retailer of jewelry and objects produced by outside manufacturers. When Cartier's son Alfred took over in 1874, the firm gradually began repairing and improving jewelry, and then designing and manufacturing their own original pieces in the late 1800\u2019s. In 1899, the move to 13 Rue de la Paix situated the business in the heart of the important jewelry and couturier quarter of Paris.Encouraged by King Edward VII, Cartier opened a branch in London in 1902 managed by Alfred's son Jacques. A royal commission was granted in 1904, followed quickly by commissions from Spain, Portugal, Russia, Siam, and Greece. These royal commissions helped to solidify Cartier's reputation among the wealthy and famous the world over.To better deal with American millionaires, who from the beginning formed a large part of Cartier's clientele, a New York branch was opened in 1909 by Alfred's other son, Pierre. Until World War I, Cartier maintained close relations with clients in Russia, and the princes and maharajas of India sought Cartier to design and mount their jewels. Jewelry and accessories were also made as stock items for the stores or were commissioned by individuals.Until the 1960\u2019s, the Paris, London, and New York branches were part of a single firm but operated independently, collaborating whenever necessary. In 1962, the New York branch was sold, followed by the Paris branch in 1965, thus ending the unity. The firm was reunited and reorganized in 1979 as Cartier Monde, and today shops and boutiques can be found in cities around the world.With each of the branches headed by a Cartier brother, the first four decades of the 20th century were a time of originality in design and technique in which a distinctive Cartier aesthetic emerged. The name change is in recognition of the historic business relationship between the City of New York and Cartier Jewelers. Pierre Cartier, the founder of the New York company for the Cartier family, lived on 52nd Street in the house where the business is now located. The home was originally purchased with a Cartier necklace.",

His community work began in Consuelo, Dominican Republic in 1951 helping the Catholic Church develop and organize the community. He was involved in improving housing conditions, and providing family, sports and youth leadership programs. In 1966 he became a scout for the Houston Astros major league baseball team. \u2018Jacobo\u2019 as he was affectionately called, had to escape the Dominican Republic because of his involvement as a union organizer. He had to flee his country unexpectedly and leave his family behind. The government considered him a communist because he believed in the rights of people. He spoke against the government and organized the people in protests and job actions. He did not stand down to the government even thought it almost cost him his life. The Catholic Church helped him escape to Canada and later he immigrated to the United States.He came to the United States in 1970. Although he did not speak the language as well as the people in the community, the strength of his convictions prompted him to get involved with the people in his community almost immediately. He began by getting involved with sports via youth programs. He worked as a janitor for Saint Martin of Tours, a local Catholic Church that he asked to allow him to open the gymnasium to create a place where young people could go and play in order to be out of the streets. He was the president of the Crotona Community Coalition for 25 years. Under his leadership, the community was transformed. As a visionary leader, he believed that the family unit is the center of the community. Jacobo understood hat nurturing the family and its needs would have a positive impact on decreasing crime and violence in the community. Housing was a big issue. He first began to fight for rent control, heating of the buildings, and renovation of the apartments. Next, Jacobo redoubled his efforts to find places and activities to involve the youth, keep them away from drugs. As he expanded his vision, he and his staff had to explore external community organizations and people that would help them obtain their goals. The Coalition reached out to politicians, private and public industries and any one else who benefits from the community. Through his leadership and that of the Crotona Community Coalition, the community received a 3 million dollar grant from Mayor Koch and the organization was able to build its first ballpark and maintain a sports program. Through the years the community has built two more parks with additional grants obtained by the coalition under Jacobo's leadership. The Crotona Community Coalition also began to buy buildings and build affordable housing. One of his big dreams for the community was to build a community center. He was able to help create the community center called the Mary Mitchell Center, which has been open since 1998. This Center is the epitome of Jacobo's primary goal of keeping the youth off the streets and away from drugs.Jacobo always wore a green baseball cap, which become a symbol of his mission. As an authentic leader he had \u201cthe integrity to walk the talk and talk the walk, self-awareness of his feelings and actions, sensitivity and empathy toward and in relationship to the community\u201d.

He was a great leader who served as a catalyst and voice for the American Civil Rights Movement. Born in Atlanta on January 15, 1929, he was the second child of Reverend Martin Luther King, Sr. and Alberta Williams King. A highly motivated child, Martin Luther King, Jr. entered Morehouse College to study religion at age 15. He was a junior in college when he was ordained a minister and made the assistant pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church. In 1948, Martin Luther King, Jr. entered Crozier Theological Seminary in Chester, Pennsylvania, where he began to seriously study the life and work of Mohandas K. Ghandi. \"I came to see for the first time,\" King wrote, \"that the Christian doctrine of love, operating through the Ghandhian method of nonviolence, is one of the most potent weapons available to an oppressed people in the struggle for freedom.\" While working toward his doctorate degree in Systematic Theology at Boston University, Martin Luther King, Jr. met and married Coretta Scott. In May, 1954, he became the new pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. On December 1, 1955, Dr. King was thrust into the forefront when Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat to a white man. Her courage triggered the Montgomery Bus Boycott and created a citywide protest against local segregation laws. Dr. King organized the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) and advised African-Americans to boycott buses and picket businesses who were in favor of segregation. In 1956, the United States Supreme Court ruled that Alabama's bus segregation laws were unconstitutional. The victory established Dr. King as a national leader and paved the way for desegregation in other areas, most notably in public schools systems around the country. In 1957, Dr. King helped organize the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) to end segregation using non-violent protests. He led numerous demonstrations against discrimination including rallies, sit-ins, the Freedom Rides and voter registration drives. The most memorable of demonstrations was the 1963 March on Washington where he delivered his famed \"I Have A Dream\" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. These efforts received international acclaim and recognition when Dr. King was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Dr. King through his powerful and sincere speeches, renewed the hopes, determination and spirit of all people seeking to improve their own lives. He inspired some to advance the principles of humanity nationwide and around the world. Dr. King's last protest took place on March 28, 1968 when he led a march in Memphis, Tennessee, in support of striking sanitation workers. He was assassinated seven days later on April 4, while staying at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee. In 1985, President Reagan signed a proclamation declaring the third Monday in January a public holiday in honor of the birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.",

Demonde, a public school teacher, noted severe deficiencies in her student\u2019s education and found it prudent to offer supplemental education in association with various local institutions of higher learning.Founded as School Settlement Association in 1901 and incorporated under that name in 1906, the organization was housed at 148 Jackson Street, just one block away from its present location. Then in 1914, a generous donation from Ms. Elvia Zabriskio enabled School Settlement to move to a facility built specifically for it at 120 Jackson Street, the site School Settlement inhabits to this day.Although the neighborhood has changed during the past century, the situation of educational deficiency Ms. Demonde encountered still exists. School Settlement has proven itself over the past hundred years to be an asset to the Williamsburg/Greenpoint community by assisting in the education of the community\u2019s youth.At present, the programs and services offered to School Settlement\u2019s participants are designed to round out and supplement the education local youth receive in public school. Homework help, arts and crafts, computer instruction, literacy and structured recreation are only a sample of the programs School Settlement offers. School Settlement also offers an AIDP program under the CAPS initiative within Automotive High School as well as a teen night program on-site, designed to offer youth an opportunity to feel relaxed, have fun and express themselves in a smoke-free, drug free and violence free environment.School Settlement has been in the same community for over a century and in the same location for almost eighty years.

He went to work early and was only 14 when he became a warehouseman at the Morel meat packing warehouse at North 10th Street and Kent Avenue. He enlisted in the Army in 1937, and when his tour of duty was over in 1940 he went back to warehouse work. However, the United States entered World War II a year later and he was back in uniform again as a Combat Engineer. Nicholas was awarded the Silver Star for Gallantry in Action for risking his life to carry several officers to safety when they were thrown from a bridge that was being shelled.Returning to the Northside after the war, Nick briefly went back to warehouse work, passed the test for the Sanitation Department, and worked there for 30 years. He was honored for his valor at Sanitation also after he pulled a police officer from the flaming wreckage of his motorcycle.After returning from the service, Nick married his one and only love, Teresa, and they had a wonderful daughter. The love and support of his family gave Nick the strength to fight for his community. On his own time, Nick began helping community people get the things they needed to survive. He was the troubleshooter, complaints bureau and ombudsman for everything that touched people\u2019s lives. In the early, years he would take people to the political clubhouse to get help there. Later on, he developed contacts directly to governmental offices and programs, although he never forgot the importance of political strength. Nick connected people and neighborhood institutions to the programs and services they needed.As vital as his help was to many people, Nick made his mark through larger issues. He led the fight against S&S Corrugated Paper Machinery when the City condemned 92 apartments to prevent S&S from moving its jobs elsewhere. Although the neighborhood fought to the last, many residents were dragged out of their homes while the bulldozers waited on the sidewalks, the houses were destroyed. In spite of this defeat, Nick and other community people had come together to form the Northside Community Development Council to fight for replacement housing, a senior citizens center and to make sure that nothing so destructive would ever again tear apart their neighborhood. Thirty years later, the Northside Community Development Council is still working to improve the environment. The Northside Senior Center is still providing services to our long-time neighbors. The homes on North 3rd Street and 4th Street are still strengthening the neighborhood.Nicholas Polonski died on April 20, 1999. He left behind a neighborhood far stronger that the neighborhood he was born into, and he left many friends who still miss him very much, still wish they could see him walking along Bedford or Driggs so they could thank him for everything he did and maybe do something for him.",

A ten-time Grammy nominee, Cruz, who sang only in her native Spanish language, received a Smithsonian Lifetime Achievement award, a National Medal of the Arts and honorary doctorates from Yale University and the University of Miami. A street in Miami was renamed in her honor, and Cruz' trademark orange, red and white polka dot dress and shoes have been placed in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institute of Technology. The Hollywood Wax Museum includes a statue of the Cuba-born songstress. Celia Cruz was born in Havana, Cuba on October 21, 1924. Growing up in the city\u2019s poor Santo Su\u00e1rez neighborhood in a household of 14 children, she stood out because of her singing ability. Cruz won a singing contest called \u201cLa hora del t\u00e9\u201d and with her mother\u2019s encouragement began to enter other contests in various parts of Cuba.Cruz\u2019s father, however, believed that she should become a teacher, an altogether more common profession for a Cuban woman at the time. She enrolled at the national teachers\u2019 college, but dropped out after finding more and more success with her music in live and radio performances. Something of a compromise was reached when she enrolled at Havana\u2019s National Conservatory of Music\u2014but there a professor encouraged her to consider a full time singing career.Her breakthrough came in 1950 when she became the lead vocalist for a big band called La Sonora Mantancera. Bandleader Regilo Martinez showed faith in Cruz when he continued to feature her despite the protests of fans of the band\u2019s previous vocalist, and once again when an American record executive resisted the idea of making a Sonora Matencera disc that featured Cruz, believing that a rumba record with a female vocalist would not sell well. Martinez promised to pay Cruz himself if the recording flopped. It did well in both Cuba and the United States, and Cruz toured widely through Central and North America with La Sonora Matancera in the 1950\u2019s.At the time of the Communist takeover of Cuba in 1959, the group was slated to tour Mexico. However, from Mexico, rather than returning to Cuba, they entered the United States and remained there. Cruz herself became a U.S citizen in 1961. Cuban Communist leader Fidel Castro was furious and barred Cruz from returning to Cuba, enforcing the ban even after Cruz\u2019s parents deaths. Cruz for her part vowed not to return to Cuba until such time as the Castro regime was deposed.Celia Cruz died on July 16, 2003 in Fort Lee, New Jersey.",

By 1893, they established a residence and sculpture studio at 467 E. 142nd Street in the Mott Haven section of The Bronx. The studio closed in 1945, the year that three of the brothers died. It was demolished in the 1970\u2019s and the site is currently occupied by a Jehovah\u2019s Witness Kingdom Hall.Original Piccirilli sculptures can be found throughout New York City and the United States. The Maine Monument at the southwest corner of Central Park (near Columbus Circle) is probably the best known original Piccirilli work. Other original Piccirilli sculptures in New York City include the Fireman\u2019s memorial on Riverside Drive and West 100th Street, the large glass sculpture, \u201cYouth Leading Industry\u201d, over the entrance to 636 Fifth Avenue in Rockefeller Center (opposite St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral) and the Policeman\u2019s Memorial at One Police Plaza.The brothers, Ferruccio, Attilio, Furio, Masaniello, Orazio and Grtulio, were also master marble carvers. Many sculptures brought their plaster casts to the studio to be carved in marble. Their best-known carving project was the Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C.\u2019s Lincoln Memorial. In New York they carved the Library Lions at 42nd Street and Fifth Avenue, all of the sculptures on the Washington Arch in Greenwich Village, the pediment of the New York Stock Exchange, and many others.In between commissions for large public sculptures, the brothers produced many small works \u2013 often for their own artistic interests. Most of these are in museums, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art, or in private collections.Attilio was co-founder of the Leonardo da Vinci Art School originally located at 288 East 10th Street in Manhattan. The school offered art education to thousands of working class New Yorkers from 1923 to 1940. Several students won the prestigious Prix de Rome, and Isamu Noguchi received his early training at \u201cThe Leonardo\u201d.The Piccirilli brothers kept a fairly low profile but were well known in certain circles. Virtually all the sculptors of their time visited the studio. Some worked there, and some actually lived there. The studio had become an important center for American art. Teddy Roosevelt, Enrico Caruso, and John D. Rocafeller also visited the studio. Fiorello LaGuardia was a close friend to the family for decades. \u201cThe Leonardo\u201d received testimonials from Calvin Coolidge, Thomas Edison, Al Smith and many, many others.",

    "reason": "Harriet Ross was born in Dorchester County, Maryland in 1820. Her parents were from the Ashanti tribe of West Africa, and they worked as slaves on the Brodas plantation. In addition to producing lumber, Edward Brodas raised slaves to rent and sell. Life was difficult on the plantation, and Harriet was hired out as a laborer by the age of 5.Harriet did not like to work indoors, and she was routinely beaten by her masters. By her early teens, Harriet was no longer allowed to work indoors and was hired out as a field hand. She was a hard worker but considered defiant and rebellious. When she was 15 years old, Harriet tried to help a runaway slave. The overseer hit her in the head with a lead weight, which put Harriet in a coma. It took months for her to recover, and for the rest of her life, Harriet suffered from blackouts.In 1844, Harriet married a free black man named John Tubman. Harriet remained a slave, but she was able to stay in Tubman's cabin at night. Although she was married, Harriet lived in fear of being shipped to the deep South, a virtual death sentence for any slave. In 1849, her fears were realized when the owner of the Brodas plantation died and many of the slaves were scheduled to be sold. After hearing of her fate, Harriet planned to escape that very night. She knew her husband would expose her, so the only person she informed was her sister.Harriet made the 90 mile trip to the Mason/Dixon line with the help of contacts along the Underground Railroad. She had to hike through swamps and woodland. Harriet's trip was successful, and she settled in Philadelphia. She worked as a dishwasher and made plans to rescue her family. The next year, Harriet traveled back to Maryland and rescued her sister's family. She then returned to transport her brothers to the North. She went back for her husband, but he had remarried and did not want to follow her. In 1857, Harriet finally returned for her parents and settled them in Auburn, New York.By this time, Harriet was becoming quite well known and huge rewards were offered for her capture. Harriet was the master of disguise. A former master did not even recognize her when they ran into each other on the street. She was nicknamed the \"Moses of her people\" for leading them to freedom. In all, Harriet made 19 trips on the Underground Railroad and freed more than 300 slaves.With the arrival of the Civil War, Harriet became a spy for the Union army. She later worked in Washington DC as a government nurse. Although Harriet won admiration from the military, she did not receive a government pension for more than 30 years. At the end of the war, Harriet returned to her parents in Auburn. She was extremely poor and the profits of a book by Sarah Bradford entitled \u201cScenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman\u201d, published in 1869, were a great financial help.In 1870, Harriet married Nelson Davis, who she had met at a South Carolina army base. They were happily married for 18 years until Davis' death. In 1896, Harriet purchased land to build a home for sick and needy blacks. However, she was unable to raise enough money to build the house and ultimately gave the land to the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. The church completed the home in 1908, and Harriet moved there several years later. She spent her last years in the home telling stories of her life to visitors. On March 10, 1913, Harriet died, of pneumonia. She was 93 years old.",

In the process of struggling to overcome poor housing and working conditions, generations of immigrants have shaped, and continue to shape, the identity and development of the community.Named after heroes from the War of 1812, Allen and Pike Streets has long been an important corridor for immigrant settlement. From the early 1800\u2019s to the 1960\u2019s, this thoroughfare was in a dense neighborhood of Eastern European Jews, Irish, Polish, Italian, and German Immigrants and African-American migrants.

The empty building was located on the south-east corner of West 122nd Street and Morningside Avenue, on the western boarder of Harlem. That empty building was to become Church of the Master, Presbyterian. It was a church building of gothic revival design and had been erected in 1894 as Morningside Presbyterian Church. Around 1930, however, Harlem began bursting at the seams with the continuous arrival of African-American immigrants from the South and elsewhere. Harlem residents began to move across northern Manhattan and into the predominantly white neighborhoods, around Morningside Church. The struggle for territory was a furious one, and often erupted in violence, but by 1938, the congregation of the Morningside Church had become so depleted that the Presbytery of New York dissolved it. From March to May 1938, the building sat empty. James H. Robinson, who grew up in Knoxville, TN, would revive the building and create the Church of the Master. From the moment he opened the doors in 1938 until he took a leave in 1959, the church was a whirl wing of activity. The sermons he delivered were almost always very inspiring, educational and spiritually gratifying. People from all over the world, at one time or another, were attracted to the Church. In 1959, Rev. Robinson took a leave in order to raise money for a new building. The Operation Crossroads Africa, however, required so much of his time that in 1961 he retired and became the Church\u2019s first pastor emeritus. Among his honors and recognitions, he had been the recipient of at least ten honorary degrees of Doctor of Philosophy.",

Ta\u00f1on in developing this \u201cstore-front\u201d church in the Bronx amidst poverty, prejudice, institutional racism, and Anglo Protestant apathy is documented well in his biography (Ramon Sanchez, Ricardo Ta\u00f1on: El Poder y la Gloria de Dios, San Juan, Puerto Rico: Romualdo Real, 1980).During the 34 year pastorate of Rev. Ta\u00f1on at \u201cJuan 3:16\u201d, 17 new churches were planted throughout the Northeast, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic; 54 pastors nurtured at \"Juan 3:16\" and sent out all over the Spanish-speaking world; hundreds trained at the Bible Institutes; one year alone 12 full-time Bible School students were mobilized and fully supported by the church. The church grew and developed a Sunday School with an average attendance of over 1,500 (with a staff of 120), over 1,000 attending every Sunday night worship service and at baptismal and evangelistic services 2,000 would \u201cjam\u201d the church. At one time it had the largest Hispanic Christian bookstore in the Northeast, whose profit at one point helped support 20 missionaries in foreign fields; a church library for its members and a print shop (which also produced thousands of Gospel tracts a year for distribution). It had several evangelistic teams and prison ministry teams, several standing Benevolent Programs, and provided the inspiration and leadership for a social service agency in the church's premises serving the church and community at large. At his official retirement on June 28, 1977, the \u201cIglesia Cristiana Juan 3:16\u201d was the largest Hispanic church in the USA.",

He began to draw at age four, copying pictures from newspaper comic strips into a book of blank papers sewn together by his mother. He was just a little older when he heard about Thipadeaux, a black artist who was teaching at the Police Athletic Academy in his neighborhood. The teacher suggested that, rather than copying from other\u2019s people\u2019s work, he try to draw some of the real people in his neighborhood. He began with his mother and aunt. He later went on to draw the adults and the wary, diffident children he saw around him. He attended Cartoonist and Illustrator\u2019s School in NY (1951-1953) and also School of Visual Arts in NY (1956-1960).By 1961 Feelings finished art school with an extensive portfolio. He tried to obtain freelance assignments but was often told by editors that he was limiting his chances by concentrating solely on black subjects. By the mid 1970\u2019s Feelings had illustrated six books, including a volume of diary extracts collected by Julius Lester, called To Be A Slave. Shortly thereafter, he was asked to do ten color illustrations for a new edition of Booker T. Washington\u2019s autobiography, Up from Slavery. Despite the tragic subject, Feelings found himself continually painting pictures in warm and radiant colors that were quite inappropriate to such a project. Knowing these pictures would convey a falsely positive image of slavery; he cancelled the contract.If the 1970\u2019s had been a time of new experiences, the 1980s found Feelings firmly grasping the themes that had been germinating within his work since his youth in Bedford-Stuyvesant. His autobiography, Black Pilgrimage, records a conversation with an eight-year-old girl that probed unforgettable for the artist. Feelings tried to explain to her that his drawings were of \u201cpretty little black children, like you.\u201d The young girl expressed her refusal to see anything beautiful about the black children, replying, \u201cAin\u2019t nothin\u2019 black pretty.\u201d Feeling\u2019s lifelong dedication to the beauty of African people and their descendants graphically illustrates his inability to accept such a hateful attitude.If any man should be regarded as the personification of the \u201cblack is beautiful\u201d philosophy, that man is Thomas Feelings. Feeling\u2019s has been passionately committed to the mission of encouraging black children to understand their own spiritual and physical beauty. By Co-naming Putman Ave. to \u201cTom Feelings Way\u201d, he will be commemorated for remaining faithful to that mission for more than 40 years.",

    "reason": "On July 29th, 1998, Jerome Robbins died of a stroke in his home in New York City. He was one of the first great American-born ballet masters and also a major Broadway and film choreographer, winning four Tony Awards and two Academy Awards. He was born Jerome Rabinowitz, October 11, 1918, son of Jewish immigrants. As a child he studied the piano and violin as well as dance. He studied ballet with Ula Duganova, Eugene Loring, and Anthony Tudor; modern dance with the New Dance League; interpretive dance with Sonya Robbins; Spanish dance with Helene Viola; and Oriental dance with Nimura, and in 1940 he joined American Ballet Theater as a dancer. In 1942 he choreographed his first ballet, Fancy Free , which recounts the adventures of three young sailors on leave. His style combined more popular dance styles with classical ballet in a way that was new at the time. In 1948 Balanchine invited him to join the newly created New York City Ballet, and in 1950 he received a Dance Magazine Award for his interpretation of Balanchine's Prodigal Son. From 1944 to 1964 he became famous beyond the world of ballet, choreographing for such Broadway musicals as On The Town, Peter Pan, The King and I, West Side Story, and Fiddler on the Roof. It was perhaps with West Side Story , collaborating with Leonard Bernstein, that he reached the pinnacle of his show business career. His dances for the Sharks and the Jets captured the restless spirit and violence of gang warfare. Leaving Broadway behind him, he returned to ballet after 1964. In his career with City Ballet he created some 50 ballets that testify to the diversity of his talent and confirm his place as a 20th century ballet master. In Afternoon of a Faun, created in 1953, he demonstrated his command of the neo-classicism with this cool and mysterious reinventing of Nyjinski's ballet. The Concert created in 1956, is a comic spoof of a classical music concert. Many of his ballets like Dances at a Gathering, have become part of the repertory of companies around the world. After the death of Balanchine in 1983, he shared the post of artistic director of The New York City Ballet with Peter Martins until 1990. He was considered by the dancers as an uncompromising taskmaster. In 1981 he received a Kennedy Center Award. He returned briefly to Broadway in 1989 with an anthology of past hits entitled Jerome Robbin's Broadway. His dedication to dance will live on in his ballets.",

Upon graduation, James Davis joined the New York City Corrections Department, serving for two years at Riker\u2019s Island before joining the New York City Transit Department as a police officer. In 1993 he was transferred to the New York City Police Department and upon graduation was assigned to the 73rd Precinct in his home borough of Brooklyn, later teaching social science as a certified New York State instructor at the New York City Police Academy and a Youth Officer at the 69th Precinct in Canarsie, Brooklyn. Prior to elected office, he made many strides to combat negative influences on children in his community including his successful crusade against the largest toy manufacturer, Toys R Us, where he persuaded the company to stop selling toy guns that appeared real or could be modified to look like a real weapon; and campaigned against MTV\u2019s daytime and evening music format, calling on the cable music station to stop showing videos during the hours of 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. that glorify violence.

His unit, attempting a quick conquest of hostile hill positions that would open the route to Nuremberg before the enemy could organize his defense of that city, was pinned down by brutal fire from rifles, machine pistols, and 2 heavy machineguns. Entirely on his own initiative, Pvt. Merrell began a single-handed assault. He ran 100 yards through concentrated fire, barely escaping death at each stride, and at pointblank range engaged 4 German machine pistolmen with his rifle, killing all of them while their bullets ripped his uniform. As he started forward again, his rifle was smashed by a sniper's bullet, leaving him armed only with 3 grenades. But he did not hesitate. He zigzagged 200 yards through a hail of bullets to within 10 yards of the first machinegun, where he hurled 2 grenades and then rushed the position ready to fight with his bare hands if necessary. In the emplacement he seized a Luger pistol and killed what Germans had survived the grenade blast. Rearmed, he crawled toward the second machinegun located 30 yards away, killing 4 Germans in camouflaged foxholes on the way, but himself receiving a critical wound in the abdomen. And yet he went on, staggering, bleeding, disregarding bullets which tore through the folds of his clothing and glanced off his helmet. He threw his last grenade into the machinegun nest and stumbled on to wipe out the crew. He had completed this self-appointed task when a machine pistol burst killed him instantly. In his spectacular 1-man attack Pvt. Merrell killed 6 Germans in the first machinegun emplacement, 7 in the next, and an additional 10 infantrymen who were astride his path to the weapons which would have decimated his unit had he not assumed the burden of the assault and stormed the enemy positions with utter fearlessness, intrepidity of the highest order, and a willingness to sacrifice his own life so that his comrades could go on to victory.",

    "reason": "\"I'm a personality as well as an actress,\" Katharine Hepburn once declared. \"Show me an actress who isn't a personality, and you'll show me a woman who isn't a star.\" Hepburn's bold, distinctive personality was apparent almost from birth. She inherited from her doctor father and suffragette mother her three most pronounced traits: an open and ever-expanding mind, a healthy body (maintained through constant rigorous exercise), and an inability to tell anything less than the truth. Hepburn was more a personality than an actress when she took the professional plunge after graduating from Bryn Mawr in 1928; her first stage parts were bits, but she always attracted attention with her distinct New England accent and her bony, sturdy frame. The actress' outspokenness lost her more jobs than she received, but, in 1932, she finally scored on Broadway with the starring role in The Warrior's Husband. She didn't want to sign the film contract offered her by RKO, so she made several \"impossible\" demands concerning salary and choice of scripts. The studios agreed to her terms, and, in 1932, she made her film debut opposite John Barrymore in A Bill of Divorcement (despite legends to the contrary, the stars got along quite well). Critical reaction to Hepburn's first film set the tone for the next decade: Some thought that she was the freshest and most original actress in Hollywood, while others were irritated by her mannerisms and \"artificial\" speech patterns. For her third film, Morning Glory (1933), Hepburn won the first of her four Oscars. But despite initial good response to her films, Hepburn lost a lot of popularity during her RKO stay because of her refusal to play the \"Hollywood game.\" She dressed in unfashionable slacks and paraded about without makeup; refused to pose for pinup pictures, give autographs, or grant interviews; and avoided mingling with her co-workers. As stories of her arrogance and self-absorption leaked out, moviegoers responded by staying away from her films. The fact that Hepburn was a thoroughly dedicated professional -- letter-perfect in lines, completely prepared and researched in her roles, the first to arrive to the set each day and the last to leave each evening -- didn't matter in those days, when style superseded substance. Briefly returning to Broadway in 1933's The Lake, Hepburn received devastating reviews from the same critics who found her personality so bracing in The Warrior's Husband. The grosses on her RKO films diminished with each release -- understandably so, since many of them (Break of Hearts [1935], Mary of Scotland [1936]) were not very good. She reclaimed the support of RKO executives after appearing in the moneymaking Alice Adams (1935) -- only to lose it again by insisting upon starring in Sylvia Scarlett (1936), a curious exercise in sexual ambiguity that lost a fortune. Efforts to \"humanize\" the haughty Hepburn personality in Stage Door (1937) and the delightful Bringing Up Baby (1938) came too late; in 1938, she was deemed \"box-office poison\" by an influential exhibitor's publication. Hepburn's career might have ended then and there, but she hadn't been raised to be a quitter. She went back to Broadway in 1938 with a part written especially for her in Philip Barry's The Philadelphia Story. Certain of a hit, she bought the film rights to the play; thus, when it ended up a success, she was able to negotiate her way back into Hollywood on her own terms, including her choice of director and co-stars. Produced by MGM in 1940, the film version was a box-office triumph, and Hepburn had beaten the \"poison\" label. In her next MGM film, Woman of the Year (1942), Hepburn co-starred with Spencer Tracy, a copacetic teaming that endured both professionally and personally until Tracy's death in 1967. After several years of off-and-on films, Hepburn scored another success with 1951's The African Queen, marking her switch from youngish sophisticates to middle-aged character leads. After 1962's Long Day's Journey Into Night, Hepburn withdrew from performing for nearly five years, devoting her attention to her ailing friend and lover Tracy. She made the last of her eight screen appearances with Tracy in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), which also featured her niece Katharine Houghton. Hepburn won her second Oscar for this film, and her third the following year for A Lion in Winter; the fourth was bestowed 13 years later for On Golden Pond (1981). When she came back to Broadway for the 1969 musical Coco, Hepburn proved that the years had not mellowed her; she readily agreed to preface her first speech with a then-shocking profanity, and, during one performance, she abruptly dropped character to chew out an audience member for taking flash pictures. Hepburn made the first of her several television movies in 1975, co-starring with Sir Laurence Olivier in Love Among the Ruins -- and winning an Emmy award, as well. Her last Broadway appearance was in 1976's A Matter of Gravity. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Hepburn continued to star on TV and in films, announcing on each occasion that it would be her last performance. She also began writing books and magazine articles, each of them an extension of her personality: self-centered, well-organized, succinct, and brutally frank (especially regarding herself). While she remained a staunch advocate of physical fitness, Hepburn was plagued by a progressive neurological disease which caused her head to shake uncontrollably -- an affliction she blithely incorporated into her screen characters. In 1994, Warren Beatty coaxed Hepburn out of her latest retirement to appear as his aristocratic grand-aunt in Love Affair. Though appearing frailer than usual, Katharine Hepburn was in complete control of herself and her craft, totally dominating her brief scenes. And into her nineties and on the threshold of her tenth decade, Katharine Hepburn remained the consummate personality, actress, and star.On June 29, 2003 Katharine Hepburn died of natural causes in Old Saybrook, Connetticut. She was 96. Biography by Hal Erickson, All Movie Guide, Yahoo! Movies.",

    "reason": "Irving Berlin wrote \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" for the first Friars Frolic in 1911. George M. Cohan wrote \"Over There\" at the Clubhouse. Victor Herbert wrote and sang his \"Here's To the Friars\" for his Testimonial Dinner in 1907. For a century the Friars Club has seen itself grow from a meeting in 1904 of the Press Agents Association at Browne's Chop House, to the most prestigious entertainment organization in the world. Its history, steeped in show business tradition, has been written through such exalted events as its Testimonial Dinners, Roasts and Friars Frolics.Through the early leadership of Abbot George M. Cohan and the dedication of personalities such as Victor Herbert and Enrico Caruso, the Friars Club established itself in the early part of the century as a leading force in the entertainment world.From its early headquarters known as the Hermitage, located at 107 West 45th St. (1908-1916) the Friars congregated both informally and at orchestrated tributes honoring the celebrities and personalities of the day.Oscar Hammerstein, in 1908, was among the first to be honored with a Testimonial Dinner and in 1911 Abbot Cohan, along with Will Rogers, Irving Berlin and Victor Herbert and his orchestra, assembled a star studded cast for the first Friars Frolics. The Frolics were known the world over and brought the music and comedy of the Friars to theaters throughout the country. The proceeds from the Frolics enabled the Friars, in 1916, to build new and larger facilities at 106 West 48th Street where they continued to hold in-house galas, resplendent in sophistication, rich in music, and overflowing with acerbic comedy. As early as 1910, the Friars were noted for their \"roasting\" techniques, \"When a man subjects himself to being honored at the hands of the Friars, he needs a steel corselet to repel the jabs of his kidders,\" quoted a New York Tribune review of the Testimonial Dinner in honor of theatrical manager, William Harris. In 1932 the depression, coupled with the westward movement of the entertainment industry, forced the Friars into some lean years. They lost the 48th Street building and, in an effort to keep their ranks united, relocated first to the Lindy's building then the Edison Hotel. In 1948, with the Friars membership fortified and the entertainment never diminishing, Abbot Milton Berle located the Club to 128 West 56th Street and finally, in 1957, to its current home at 57 East 55th Street.In 1988 the Friars welcomed women to join the formerly all-male bastion. Liza Minnelli became the first official female Friar and through the years their ranks have grown steadily among the Membership.When people think of the Friars Club they may think of its Testimonial Dinners, its Roasts, its Frolics, its comedians, its charities, its history whatever the context, it is undeniably unique.It is the Friars heritage which has enabled it to flourish to this day and continues to stand as a tribute to those early leaders. Cohan, Herbert, Berlin, Rogers, Caruso and so many others brought the entertainment community together and did what they did best entertained. Today, almost one hundred years after that first gathering, Friars still get together to do what they do best, honor the tradition of the Friars motto, first penned in 1907, Prae Omnia Fraternitas, \"Before all things, Brotherhood.\"",

    "reason": "Jan Rodrigues/Juan Rodriguez was a mulatto or Black man from Santo Domingo (the Spanish island-colony also known as La Espa\u00f1ola in Spanish and as Hispaniola in English) that arrived in the Hudson River Harbor in 1613 as part of the crew of a merchant Dutch ship exploring the area for its trade potential. After a few weeks in the area, the captain decided to return to Holland, but Rodriguez refused, arguing he was a free man and warning that if he was forced to go on the ship he would jump overboard. His Dutch captain accepted his demands and in payment for the work done as part of the ship\u2019s crew, Rodriguez was compensated with a number of hatchets, presumably to trade them with the local Algonquian Amerindians. The ship left with the entire crew for Holland leaving Rodriguez in the area. The following year, 1614, another Dutch merchant ship arrived in the Hudson, found Rodriguez, and hired him to assist in trading with the local Amerindians. Shortly afterwards, the same captain that had brought over Rodriguez as sailor in 1613, arrived for a second time on a ship in the Hudson. A dispute erupted between the two Dutch captains and crews over the primacy in the right to trade with the local Amerindians. Rodriguez himself was involved in the scuffle. Once the crews were back in Holland, they took their contention to court and a notarial record was generated with their depositions about the past events in the Hudson. These depositions, held at the Archives of the City of Amsterdam, became the only source known so far on the story of Juan Rodriguez. They were first published by Simon Hart in 1959 in his book The prehistory of the New Netherland Company. (Amsterdam: City of Amsterdam Press). No other documents have been found about the life of Rodriguez after 1614. Further research work in archival documents pertaining to Hispaniola in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century conducted by the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute at The City College of New York have revealed the existence of a number of individuals with the name Juan Rodrigues or Rodriguez (spelled indistinctly, with S or Z, in the Spanish documents) in the island-colony of Santo Domingo at the time, including three explicitly tried by the authorities for smuggling of goods with Dutch merchants in the island. The historical record clearly shows Jan Rodrigues/Juan Rodriguez residing somewhere at the Hudson Bay area between 1613 and 1614. As a result, Rodriguez is considered the first non-Amerindian person to ever have resided in what is today New York City. The arrival of Juan Rodriguez in 1613 indicates that the Dominican/Latino population\u2019s relationship with the second capital of the country, as New York is called, began many years ago and that those who left the country of origin afterwards merely followed the trail of Juan Rodriguez, first non-native man in residing in the city. A conclusive statement on the role played by Rodr\u00edguez is that in 1613 it had been expressly declared that no other member of the Dutch crew had stayed behind in the Hudson area. This is confirmed by the documents found in the Archives of the City of Amsterdam, where the Dutch sailors declare that when the Dutch ship sailed away from the river, a mulatto born in Santo Domingo stayed ashore at the same place.",

He played in the minor leagues for two seasons and was picked up by the New York Giants in 1951. Although having no hits in his first twelve at bats, he finally hit a home run over the left field fence of the Polo Grounds and from then on, his batting average improved throughout the season and won the 1951 Rookie of the Year Award. In the 1951 World Series, Mays was part of the first all-African-America outfield in major league history along with Hank Thompson and Monte Irvin in game one of the series. Mays was drafted by the United States Army in 1952 during the Korean War and missed most of the 1952 season and all of the 1953 season. He returned to the Giants in 1954 and won the National League Most Valuable Player Award and the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of the year. Also, the Giants won the National League pennant and went on to dominate in the 1954 World Series. In this series, Mays made an over-the-shoulder running grab referred to as, \u201cThe Catch,\u201d which is considered the iconic image of his career and one of baseball\u2019s most memorable fielding plays which prevented two runners from scoring. In 1955, he led the league with 51 home runs and in 1956, he hit 36 home runs and stole 40 bases, being only the second player, and first National League player to join the 30-30 Club. In 1957, he won the first of twelve consecutive Gold Glove Awards and also became the fourth player in Major League history to join the 20-20-20 Club. He also stole 38 bases that year and became the second player in baseball history to reach 20 in each of those four categories, doubles, triples, home runs, steals in the same season. After the 1957 season, Mays moved with the Giants franchise to San Francisco. One of his best games was on April 30, 1961 when Mays hit four home runs against the Milwaukee Braves. In 1970, Mays was named the 1960\u2019s \u201cPlayer of the Decade.\u201d In 1972, Mays was traded to the New York Mets where he retired after the 1973 season with a lifetime batting average of .302 with 660 home runs, 7,095 fielding putouts in the outfield which remains the major league record and played in 24 All-Star games. After his retirement, Mays continued working with the New York Mets as a hitting instructor until the 1979 season. Later on, he became a full-time special assistant to the Giants for over 25 years and served on the advisory board of the Baseball Assistance Team helping former players with finances and medical issues. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in January 1979 and every May 24th in San Francisco is celebrated as Willie Mays Day. He was also very involved with his charity, the Say Hey Foundation which is dedicated to helping underprivileged youth. In addition, he is involved in charitable events such as the Giants Community Fund, the San Francisco Food Bank and the Whitney Young Child Development Center in Hunter\u2019s Point. He has also received honorary degrees from Ohio State University, Ohio and Yale University, Connecticut and Mills College and Dartmouth. He was honored by Major League Baseball and the Giants at the 2007 All-Star game for his lifetime achievements and was also honored with the Boys & Girls Club at Hunters Point officially becoming the Willie Mays Boys & Girls Club at Hunters Point after the clubhouse was rebuilt. The Sporting News ranked him second among the 100 greatest baseball players of the century and was listed eighth of the top 50 athletes of the century by ESPN.",

Sister Marcellus deeply influenced countless people in the 47 years of Ministry in Transfiguration. While her main ministry was formal education in Transfiguration School she will also be well remembered and loved for her various extracurricular activities. While teacher and principal she was also the director of the School Chorus, as well as director of the English Choir in church while being the organist for the Sunday Masses. During the 1970\u2019s and 80\u2019s one of her greatest achievements was the formation and direction of the Drama Guild. Performances included South Pacific, West Side Story, The King and I, The Mercado, Fiddler on the Roof, The Sound of Music and Guys and Dolls. But however great these accomplishments were, Sister Marcellus\u2019 true joy came from the Spiritual roots and formation which began in Brentwood in 1954 as a Sister of Saint Joseph and enabled her through the years to be a true \u201cSister of the Neighborhood.\u201d",

    "reason": "Willie Mays was born on May 6, 1931, in Westfield, Alabama, and began playing baseball at an early age. He played in the minor leagues for two seasons and was picked up by the New York Giants in 1951. Although having no hits in his first twelve at bats, he finally hit a home run over the left field fence of the Polo Grounds and from then on, his batting average improved throughout the season and won the 1951 Rookie of the Year Award. In the 1951 World Series, Mays was part of the first all-African-America outfield in major league history along with Hank Thompson and Monte Irvin in game one of the series. Mays was drafted by the United States Army in 1952 during the Korean War and missed most of the 1952 season and all of the 1953 season. He returned to the Giants in 1954 and won the National League Most Valuable Player Award and the Hickok Belt as top professional athlete of the year. Also, the Giants won the National League pennant and went on to dominate in the 1954 World Series. In this series, Mays made an over-the-shoulder running grab referred to as, \u201cThe Catch,\u201d which is considered the iconic image of his career and one of baseball\u2019s most memorable fielding plays which prevented two runners from scoring. In 1955, he led the league with 51 home runs and in 1956, he hit 36 home runs and stole 40 bases, being only the second player, and first National League player to join the 30-30 Club. In 1957, he won the first of twelve consecutive Gold Glove Awards and also became the fourth player in Major League history to join the 20-20-20 Club. He also stole 38 bases that year and became the second player in baseball history to reach 20 in each of those four categories, doubles, triples, home runs, steals in the same season. After the 1957 season, Mays moved with the Giants franchise to San Francisco. One of his best games was on April 30, 1961 when Mays hit four home runs against the Milwaukee Braves. In 1970, Mays was named the 1960\u2019s \u201cPlayer of the Decade.\u201d In 1972, Mays was traded to the New York Mets where he retired after the 1973 season with a lifetime batting average of .302 with 660 home runs, 7,095 fielding putouts in the outfield which remains the major league record and played in 24 All-Star games. After his retirement, Mays continued working with the New York Mets as a hitting instructor until the 1979 season. Later on, he became a full-time special assistant to the Giants for over 25 years and served on the advisory board of the Baseball Assistance Team helping former players with finances and medical issues. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in January 1979 and every May 24th in San Francisco is celebrated as Willie Mays Day. He was also very involved with his charity, the Say Hey Foundation which is dedicated to helping underprivileged youth. In addition, he is involved in charitable events such as the Giants Community Fund, the San Francisco Food Bank and the Whitney Young Child Development Center in Hunter\u2019s Point. He has also received honorary degrees from Ohio State University, Ohio and Yale University, Connecticut and Mills College and Dartmouth. He was honored by Major League Baseball and the Giants at the 2007 All-Star game for his lifetime achievements and was also honored with the Boys & Girls Club at Hunters Point officially becoming the Willie Mays Boys & Girls Club at Hunters Point after the clubhouse was rebuilt.

    "reason": "Jan Rodrigues/Juan Rodriguez was a mulatto or Black man from Santo Domingo (the Spanish island-colony also known as La Espa\u00f1ola in Spanish and as Hispaniola in English) that arrived in the Hudson River Harbor in 1613 as part of the crew of a merchant Dutch ship exploring the area for its trade potential. After a few weeks in the area, the captain decided to return to Holland, but Rodriguez refused, arguing he was a free man and warning that if he was forced to go on the ship he would jump overboard. His Dutch captain accepted his demands and in payment for the work done as part of the ship\u2019s crew, Rodriguez was compensated with a number of hatchets, presumably to trade them with the local Algonquian Amerindians. The ship left with the entire crew for Holland leaving Rodriguez in the area. The following year, 1614, another Dutch merchant ship arrived in the Hudson, found Rodriguez, and hired him to assist in trading with the local Amerindians. Shortly afterwards, the same captain that had brought over Rodriguez as sailor in 1613, arrived for a second time on a ship in the Hudson. A dispute erupted between the two Dutch captains and crews over the primacy in the right to trade with the local Amerindians. Rodriguez himself was involved in the scuffle. Once the crews were back in Holland, they took their contention to court and a notarial record was generated with their depositions about the past events in the Hudson. These depositions, held at the Archives of the City of Amsterdam, became the only source known so far on the story of Juan Rodriguez. They were first published by Simon Hart in 1959 in his book The prehistory of the New Netherland Company. (Amsterdam: City of Amsterdam Press). No other documents have been found about the life of Rodriguez after 1614. Further research work in archival documents pertaining to Hispaniola in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century conducted by the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute at The City College of New York have revealed the existence of a number of individuals with the name Juan Rodrigues or Rodriguez (spelled indistinctly, with S or Z, in the Spanish documents) in the island-colony of Santo Domingo at the time, including three explicitly tried by the authorities for smuggling of goods with Dutch merchants in the island. The historical record clearly shows Jan Rodrigues/Juan Rodriguez residing somewhere at the Hudson Bay area between 1613 and 1614. As a result, Rodriguez is considered the first non-Amerindian person to ever have resided in what is today New York City. The arrival of Juan Rodriguez in 1613 indicates that the Dominican/Latino population\u2019s relationship with the second capital of the country, as New York is called, began many years ago and that those who left the country of origin afterwards merely followed the trail of Juan Rodriguez, first non-native man in residing in the city. A conclusive statement on the role played by Rodr\u00edguez is that in 1613 it had been expressly declared that no other member of the Dutch crew had stayed behind in the Hudson area. This is confirmed by the documents found in the Archives of the City of Amsterdam, where the Dutch sailors declare that when the Dutch ship sailed away from the river, a mulatto born in Santo Domingo stayed ashore at the same place.",

On September 23, 1868, the men met at the farm of Manuel Rojas in Pezuelas, Lares. Led by Manuel Rojas, the group marched towards Lares and took Lares without any resistance before the Spaniards became aware of the revolt. The group then formed a provisional government declaring an independent Puerto Rico Republic. The following day, the group marched to San Sebasti\u00e1n where the Spanish militia awaited them and within 24 hours the revolt, which was twelve years in the planning, was defeated by the Spanish government. Of the participants 20 escaped, 8 died in action, 7 were tried by the War Council. Four months later, Spain declared a general amnesty. No one was executed or kept in jail over 4 months, however 80 died in jail from yellow fever. Shortly after the revolt, Spain gave the Island many liberal reforms and extended some of the liberal constitution to Puerto Rico that it had allowed during the war in Spanish America. Puerto Rico received provincial status and Spanish Citizenship was granted to the criollos. Some political reforms granted were allowing Boricuas to participate in special elections and to organize themselves into officially recognized political parties.

    "reason": "Angelo Campanella served in the United States Army for 2 years during WWII. He later became a celebrated ice cream vendor and a mainstay of the Bensonhurst community and served generations of Brooklynites over the course of 50 years. He served as the eyes and ears of the community by alerting the authorities if he ever saw a dangerous situation developing or any threat to his community, helping avert crimes before they took place. He also warned children about drug use and offered advice to stay away from delinquent behavior. This commitment to helping others was evident one afternoon when he saved a customer\u2019s baby from choking to death, rushing the distraught young mother and child to the hospital just in time to save the child\u2019s life. He once pulled a mother and baby out from a flipped car that was in danger of catching fire and also intervened in an attempted hit-and-run by a drunk driver when a customer was hit shortly after purchasing ice cream. He witnessed the crime and blocked the roadway with his ice cream truck, ensuring that the drunk driver could not flee the scene and was apprehended by police officers. His service has been documented in a number of publications including The New York Times, The New York Daily News and People Magazine. He began his business in 1944 growing his business from a freezer mounted on a bicycle, to a Ford Model A, a Model T and eventually a 1971 Chevrolet ice cream truck. Residents of Bensonhurst knew they could rely on Chubby to alert the authorities or lend advice to youth who would have otherwise turned to drugs and crime. He organized and carried out many community food drives on behalf of his less fortunate neighbors, annual winter block parties and toy drives and fundraiser galas for residents battling cancer. He also donated countless ice cream cones to children who were short of change.",

McCloy. In approving the committee's recommendation for an African-American parachute battalion, Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall decided to start with a company. On February 25, 1943, the 555th Parachute Infantry Company was constituted. On December 19, 1943, Army Ground Forces authorized the activation of the company as an all-African-American unit with African-American officers, as well as African-American enlisted men. All unit members were to be volunteers, with an enlisted cadre to be selected from personnel of the 92d Infantry Division at Fort Huachuca, Arizona. The company was officially activated on December 30, 1943 at Fort Benning, Georgia. After several months of training, the unit moved to Camp Mackall, North Carolina, where it was reorganized and redesignated on November 25, 1944 as Company A of the newly-activated 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion. The battalion did not serve overseas during World War II. However, in May 1945 it was sent to the west coast of the United States to combat forest fires ignited by Japanese balloons carrying incendiary bombs. Although this potentially serious threat did not materialize, the 555th fought numerous other forest fires. Stationed at Pendleton Field, Oregon, with a detachment in Chico, California, unit members courageously participated in dangerous fire-fighting missions throughout the Pacific Northwest during the summer and fall of 1945, earning the nickname \"Smoke Jumpers\" in addition to \"Triple Nickles.\" Soon after returning to Camp Mackall in October 1945, the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion was transferred to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, its home for the next two years. During this period the unit was attached to the elite 82nd Airborne Division. When the battalion was inactivated on December 15, 1947, most of its personnel were reassigned to the division's organic 3rd Battalion, 505th Airborne Infantry.

Shortly after the Civil War broke out she was freed by Union soldiers and soon went to work for the Federal Army as a paid servant.

He described her as 5' 9\", with black eyes, black hair and black complexion. An Army surgeon examined Cathay and determined the recruit was fit for duty, thus sealing her fate in history as the first documented black woman to enlist in the Army even though U.S. Army regulations forbade the enlistment of women. She was assigned to the 38th United States Infantry and traveled throughout the west with her unit. The traveling took a toll on her and seemingly her health was suffering, as she was recorded as being in four different hospitals on five separate occasions. Amazingly, during these various hospitalizations, it was never discovered that she was female. Over her two year stint in the Army, she participated in regular garrison duties but there is no record that she ever saw direct combat while she was enlisted.

He would later become a prominent figure of the Civil Rights Movement. He was born in Harlem and at age fourteen became a member of the Pentecostal Church where he began to preach. In the early 1940s, he abandoned his religious faith to focus on literature. He began writing short stories, essays and book reviews which were published in Notes of a Native Son in 1955. His most known and celebrated work is his partially autobiographical novel Go Tell It On The Mountain. His writings denounce racism and more precisely the injustices done to the African-American community in the United States in the 1920s. The book is considered one of the literary masterpieces of that era. In 1956, he published Giovanni\u2019s Room in which he openly discusses the issues of race and homosexuality. In 1957 he returned to the United States to participate in the Civil Rights Movement alongside Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. In 1961, he published an important essay on race relations and the role of writers in society entitled Nobody Knows my Name: More Notes of a Native Son, which would be followed in 1962 by the novel Another Country. In 1963, he published The Fire Next Time which is widely considered one of the most brilliant essays on the history of black protest. He also wrote two plays, The Amen Corner (1955), and, Blues for Mister Charlie (1964). He won the prestigious George Polk prize in 1963.

He was born in Hamburg, Germany, and after Hitler came to power in 1933, his family moved to London. He worked with survivors of Nazi concentration camps and Soviet labor camps, and with North African Jews who had fled the civil war in Algeria. He moved to New York in 1964 and soon started his campaign to help Soviet Jews. He orchestrated the movement to free Soviet Jews with student demonstrations at the Soviet Mission to the United Nations beginning in 1964. On April 27, 1964, in the Philosophy Hall on the Columbia University campus, around 200 students from Yeshiva University, the Jewish Theological Seminary, Queens College and Columbia gathered to plan the May Day protest. The May Day protest consisted of a thousand young men and women, almost all Jewish, who answered his summons who marched silently in two neat rows for four hours in the conservative clothes they wore to synagogue. Other demonstrations, some of which attracted as many as 3,000 protesters, were held on Jewish holidays and every rally included posters declaring \u201cLet my people go,\u201d the line from Exodus 9:1 that became the clarion call of the movement. His demand was free emigration, not just an easing of restrictions. He publicized the cases of individual Jews in Russia, despite mainstream organizations\u2019 worries that this might endanger them. He tried to expose Soviet anti-Semitism and hypocrisy, in the belief that Moscow was more sensitive to international opinion than many thought. He lobbied Washington, and personally conveyed his support to Soviet \u201crefuseniks\u201d who protested being denied permission to emigrate. His grass-roots movement contributed to legislation that eventually helped liberalize Moscow\u2019s emigration policies, an issue that President Ronald Reagan personally pressed the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on. As a result, more than 1.5 million Soviet Jews were allowed to move to Israel and elsewhere.",

In the early 1990s, she became involved with the parish\u2019s Rite of Christian Initiation as Adults (RCIA) program, in which she served as a volunteer helping mostly young adults and teens who wanted to learn about the Catholic faith and become initiated members of the church. In volunteering for RCIA, Barbara learned that many of the young adults and teens in the program often had been troubled through their childhoods and adolescent years, due to divorce, substance abuse, domestic violence, life-threatening illnesses, and serious financial problems. In 1997, with the help of Father Dominick Cutrone, who was then Pastor of Our Lady of Grace Church, and Father James Tighe, she founded the Youth Ministry program in the parish, called Teen Group, to help and mentor the troubled and broken teens, including those she encountered through the RCIA program. She became a certified youth minister and also received a certificate in lay ministry from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens in order to serve as the Director of the program, a position she held from Teen Group\u2019s creation until her death. She also launched Teen Group to give young people a chance to give back to their community and to their parish through service projects. The group aims to provide service for the parish and to the community by helping those in need. The Youth Ministry program spearheaded projects and initiatives which aimed to help the sick, elderly, homeless, and poor. Ms. Dattilo, as the Director, organized these community service activities which included shoveling snow in the winter for elderly residents, making sandwiches for the homeless, serving hot meals in the parish hall for the less fortunate, sending gifts and cards to veterans and soldiers overseas and raising monies for charities that help the poor and victims of natural disasters. The teens also assist the sick, elderly and disabled with tasks including shopping, cleaning, and laundry. In addition, the assist at the annual Anointing Mass for those who cannot regularly attend on their own and at the Lenten Soup Supper, which proceeds donated to a local charity each year. These initiatives have all combined to greatly improve the quality of life for many elderly, sick and disabled community members. Teen Group also provided guidance, counseling, and direction to hundreds of local teenagers throughout the southern Brooklyn community. Through the Teen Group program, Ms. Dattilo was able to give the teens of the greater southwest Brooklyn community a place where they could learn how to make healthy decisions and learn to grow into successful young adults.

He moved to New Rochelle, New York, and set up a studio with the cartoonist Clyde Forsythe and produced work for such magazines as Life, Literary Digest, and Country Gentleman. In 1916, he painted his first cover for The Saturday Evening Post, the magazine considered by Rockwell to be the \u201cgreatest show window in America.\u201d Over the next 47 years, another 321 Rockwell covers would appear on the cover of the Post. Rockwell\u2019s reflected small-town American life. In 1943, inspired by President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s address to Congress, Rockwell painted the Four Freedoms paintings. They were reproduced in four consecutive issues of The Saturday Evening Post with essays by contemporary writers. His interpretations of Freedom of Speech, Freedom to Worship, Freedom from Want, and Freedom from Fear proved to be enormously popular. The works toured the United States in an exhibition that was jointly sponsored by the Post and the U.S. Treasury Department and, through the sale of war bonds, raised more than $130 million for the war effort. During his 10-year association with Look magazine, he painted pictures illustrating some of his deepest concerns and interests, including civil rights, America\u2019s war on poverty, and the exploration of space. In 1973, Rockwell established a trust to preserve his artistic legacy by placing his works in the custodianship of the Old Corner House Stockbridge Historical Society, later to become Norman Rockwell Museum at Stockbridge. The trust now forms the core of the Museum\u2019s permanent collections. In 1977, Rockwell received the nation\u2019s highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal.",

He was born in 1892, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan and his family later moved to Staten Island. He became New York City's half-mile and mile champion in track while at Curtis High School. In the next few years, he set three world records outdoors and six indoors, and won nine United States titles. He was the captain of the Irish-American Athletic Club, America's dominant track team of the time, for five consecutive years. In 1911, at age 18, he won the 600-yard and 1,000-yard titles in the Amateur Athletic Union two-day national indoor championships. In 1913, he became the only runner ever to win both titles in one day and in 1912, he lowered his world record for 1,500 meters to 3 minutes 55.8 seconds. After crossing the finish line, he kept running, hoping to break the world record for the mile of 4:15.4, but failed by a fifth of a second. He entered the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm as the world-record holder and favorite in the 1,500 meters. During the race, he led until the last 8 meters, when Arnold Strode Jackson of Britain ran by and just beat him. In 1915, he was suspended by the A.A.U. saying he had requested exorbitant expense money for running in a meet in Troy, N.Y. He denied the charge and was reinstated in 1923. After his running career, he worked as a deputy clerk for the Southern District of the United States Federal Court in Manhattan and also served as an unpaid press-box steward at Madison Square Garden track meets and at the Penn Relays in Philadelphia. He was honored by the New York Road Runners Club. In 1984, in the Olympic torch relay from the United Nations Secretariat in Manhattan to Los Angeles, the torch was carried on the first kilometer by Bill Thorpe, Jim Thorpe's grandson, and Gina Hemphill, Jesse Owens's granddaughter.

The lives that have been saved through the efforts of CMS can be attributed to the public outrage at the untimely death of D\u2019Aja Naquai Robinson.",

    "reason": "Maria Valentin was born in Dajabon, Dominican Republic. In 1962, she fled the country seeking safety from the dictatorship of Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo Molina's regime. Ms. Valentin, was specifically targeted for speaking against Molina\u2019s cruelty towards children. Prior to fleeing the country, she was on Molina\u2019s hit list to be murdered. The United States of America offered refuge and she arrived in New York City with only $5 in her pocket. She lived in a room on 172nd Street and performed odd jobs until 1966 when she earned enough money to move uptown to 184th Street. Her youngest daughter was born with Down Syndrome and she did not institutionalize her as was suggested at that time, instead she opened her home to other needy kids and raised them all together. She provided \"Safe Haven\" prior to our \"Safe Haven Laws\" for the children of the homeless, street workers, the mentally ill, and the drug addicted and she raised over 100 children. The children would be dropped off by their parents and no questions were asked with the exception of the child's name and birthdate. She was known as \"Mami Flor\" because she was everybody's mother. Maria gave them unconditional love and every child that entered her home was fed, taken to school and given a place to sleep, if needed. She took it upon herself to keep or make their respective doctor\u2019s appointments, ensure each child received religious instruction and see that each child attended mass on Sundays. Many of the children she cared for received their First Holy Communion and Confirmation because of her. She often took children sight-seeing and on summer vacations allowing many to experience places they would not otherwise, giving them memories to cherish forever. Most importantly, she made sure each child was cared for and loved unconditionally as if they were her very own. A memory often shared is that all the children would line up in the kitchen with their personal plate (all plates and cups were marked with their names in marker) to be served their food. They would all receive .50 cents every Sunday for church offerings. She leaves behind 5 biological children, 12 grandchildren, and 12 great-children with over 100 \"adopted children\" and their offspring.",

The Miolans' were targeted by the regime and Ms. Valentin, specifically for speaking against and his cruelty against children; she was on his hit list to be murdered. The United States of America offered refuge and she arrived in New York City with only $5 in her pocket. She lived in a room on 172nd Street and performed odd jobs until 1966 when she earned enough money to move uptown to 184th Street. Her youngest daughter was born with Down Syndrome and she did not institutionalize her as was suggested at that time, instead she opened her home to other needy kids and raised them all together. She provided \"Safe Haven\" prior to our \"Safe Haven Laws\" for the children of the homeless, street workers, mentally-ill, drug addicted and she raised over 100 children. The children would be dropped off by their parents and no questions were asked with the exception of the child's name and birthdate. She was known as \"Mami Flor\" because she was everybody's mother. Maria gave them unconditional love and every child that entered her home was fed, taken to school and given a place to sleep if needed. She took it upon herself to keep or make their respective doctor\u2019s appointments, make sure each child went to religion instructions and mass on Sundays. Many of the children she cared for received their First Holy Communion and Confirmation because of her. She often took children sight-seeing and on summer vacations allowing many to experience places they would not otherwise, giving them memories to cherish forever. Most importantly, she made sure each child was cared for and loved unconditionally as if they were her very own. A memory often shared is that all the children would line up in the kitchen with their personal plate (all plates and cups were marked with their names in marker) to be served their food. They would all receive .50 cents every Sunday for church offerings.

The organization\u2019s history and values are rooted in the \u201cCaggianesi di Mutuo Soccorso\u201d (Caggianesi Provident Society), a society founded on March 31, 1903, whose mission was to preserve Caggianesi culture, celebrate America, and help all those in need. During the first Sunday of May and October of each year, Association Caggianesi D\u2019America organizes events to celebrate Madonna del Rosario, the patron saint of Caggiano and the society, and St. Anthony of Padua. These events include religious services in Italian, and traditional foods being shared. The organization also puts on an annual gala which awards community leaders, and various different social events such as picnics, dinners, and Christmas parties. The organization also marches annually in the Christopher Columbus Parade. The organization awards scholarships to graduating high school seniors for college, and provides support to charitable organizations. Some of these include the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, St. Francis Church, St. Dominic Church, as well as direct support to needy Caggianese families in New York. In the past, the organization has sponsored the Folkorico Group, a group of approximately 40 Caggianese youth, to perform in the Tri-State area. The group performs songs and dances in 1800\u2019s attire and uses traditional instruments. The work of the organization is also international. With an established partnership with a formal partnership with the Federation of Campania and the village of Caggiano, the organization puts on events there as well as exchanges for their members. This year, members of the organization, Giuseppe Vecchio and Antonio Mastroberti, held an event at the Guiscardo Castle in Caggiano, Italy, titled \u201cParla-M Lu Ndiale-TT,\u201d which introduced a new project to preserve the native Caggianesi dialect and culture. The organization has also had student exchanges and exchanges with older Italian-Americans with the aim of reconnecting with their family\u2019s birthplace in Caggiano.",

He was all city football quarterback and starting point guard for the Bayside basketball team. He traded his football for clippers and went into business with older brother becoming a barber. He quickly became one of the most sought after barbers in New York. When he wasn\u2019t cutting hair, he spent his time mentoring younger Rifles players and Campus Magnet football players. On his days off, he would make house calls to a young man with autism just to cut his hair and make him smile. When his beloved Rifles would host carwash fundraisers, he showed up just to donate in order to help them meet their goals even when he did not need a car wash. He held annual Back to School Picnics in which he provided a day of free food, games, tournaments, and a $200 backpack give away filled with school supplies for the children of Hollis Queens. He spent holidays giving free haircuts to the homeless and if a single mother could not afford her sons haircut, he would offer a free haircut.",

    "reason": "Beulah Sanders was a relentless advocate for welfare recipients\u2019 rights. Born in North Carolina, she moved to New York City at age 22 in 1957. She was a founding member of the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO) and was elected as its chair multiple times. She served as a voice for her family, her community and every poor mother throughout the United States. During the Nixon administration, she and the NWRO were active in the face of new federal work requirements for welfare in the form of the Family Assistance Plan. During its time in Congress, she fought to get the voices of those on welfare, particularly those of urban mothers, heard to the senate committee members in charge of the legislation. The NWRO served as an incredibly powerful advocate for poor women and children to be collectively heard in government. Sander\u2019s tenure as chair of the NWRO coincided with one of the most active points of the NWRO\u2019s existence as many conservatives looked to further restrict the extent of welfare within the United States. In New York City, she led a march of nearly 2,000 mothers through the rain to demand the city\u2019s welfare commissioner provide the long awaited clothing vouchers for children before the school year started. In 1967, when the clothing grants had stalled, she directly confronted Mayor John Lindsay with a press conference and occupation of the steps of City Hall. With these marches, she was able to garner significant media attention and use the newfound momentum to help launch the NWRO. With support from labor groups, tenants organizations and anti-Vietnam activists, as well as a strong source of funding in the Community Action Program, she helped build and eventually became the chair of the largest welfare rights group throughout the entire United States with over 100,000 members. She also attended numerous international peace conferences in war torn parts of the world, such as Vietnam. In 1968, she became an educative force to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and along with the NWRO, provided him and his associates with a basic understanding of the welfare system. Welfare reform quickly became an integral part in the Poor People\u2019s Campaign spearheaded by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and provided a strong link between the civil rights and anti-poverty movements. Her activism continued until her death in 1984 and provided a platform from which many more marginalized women and children have had a voice both locally and nationally.",

After France abolished slavery in the territory in 1794, Toussaint supported the French rulers of the country against British invaders and was made a general in 1795. In 1801 he succeeded, after many struggles, in liberating Saint-Domingue from French control and became president for life of a new republic. In 1802 Napoleon sent troops under the command of his brother-in-law, General Charles Victor Emmanuel Leclerc, to subdue the Haitians. Toussaint was defeated, captured, and accused of conspiracy.

She was a founding member of the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO) and was elected as its chair multiple times. She served as a voice for her family, her community and every poor mother throughout the United States. During the Nixon administration, she and the NWRO were active in the face of new federal work requirements for welfare in the form of the Family Assistance Plan. During its time in Congress, she fought to get the voices of those on welfare, particularly those of urban mothers, heard to the senate committee members in charge of the legislation. The NWRO served as an incredibly powerful advocate for poor women and children to be collectively heard in government. Sander\u2019s tenure as chair of the NWRO coincided with one of the most active points of the NWRO\u2019s existence as many conservatives looked to further restrict the extent of welfare within the United States. In New York City, she led a march of nearly 2,000 mothers through the rain to demand the city\u2019s welfare commissioner provide the long awaited clothing vouchers for children before the school year started. In 1967, when the clothing grants had stalled, she directly confronted Mayor John Lindsay with a press conference and occupation of the steps of City Hall. With these marches, she was able to garner significant media attention and use the newfound momentum to help launch the NWRO. With support from labor groups, tenants organizations and anti-Vietnam activists, as well as a strong source of funding in the Community Action Program, she helped build and eventually became the chair of the largest welfare rights group throughout the entire United States with over 100,000 members. She also attended numerous international peace conferences in war torn parts of the world, such as Vietnam. In 1968, she became an educative force to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and along with the NWRO, provided him and his associates with a basic understanding of the welfare system. Welfare reform quickly became an integral part in the Poor People\u2019s Campaign spearheaded by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and provided a strong link between the civil rights and anti-poverty movements. Her activism continued until her death in 1984 and provided a platform from which many more marginalized women and children have had a voice both locally and nationally.",

Rincon Criollo has held numerous community gatherings, musical performances and other cultural festivities. Early on, it became a cultural center for musicians to perform Bomba y Plena lessons, as well learn instrument making from Chema and other members. Bomba y Plena lessons were taught for free to people of all ages within the community. Soto became a mentor to many through his teachings of songs and playing of instruments. While he was known as the man who built Rincon Criollo, he also had a hand (literally) in most of the other local casitas in the Melrose neighborhoods. He changed the landscape and the soundscape of the community with his casita as the leading site on the mainland for Puerto Rican music. After years of gardening, taking care of the land, planting fruits and vegetables \u2013 grapes, peaches, cabbages, green peppers, tomatoes and more, he enjoyed distributing items to the community at no cost. The community still comes to pick fresh fruits and vegetables from the garden. In 1987, the Casita de Chema joined the city\u2019s Green Thumb Community Garden Program. He created the blueprint for the Gardenhaus Green Thumb Guidebook with step by step instructions on how to build a casita. In 1990, the Bronx Council of the Arts held a landmark exhibition called \u201cCasitas\u201d where Chema, along with others, went to build replicas of casitas that were showcased at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C., Hostos Community College, and the Bronx Museum in tribute to Puerto Rican culture. Rincon Criollo joined with Hostos CC\u2019s Center for the Arts and Culture in establishing the biennial Bomplenzo festival in 2000, which traditionally includes the closing event, \u201cVente-Tu\u201d at the casita.

However, Punjabi identity also included those who did not belong to any of the historical tribes. With the passage of time, tribal structures are coming to an end and are being replaced with a more cohesive and holistic society, as community building and group cohesiveness form the new pillars of Punjabi society. In relative contemporary terms, Punjabis can be referred to in three most common subgroups: Punjabi Muslims, Punjabi Sikhs and Punjabi Hindus. Due to political, social and economic factors a significant number of Punjabi Sikhs have immigrated to build their homes throughout the nation\u2014particularly in the last three decades or so. Specifically, Richmond Hill, New York, has a high concentration of these immigrants and is a community that can be identified as a Punjabi Sikh enclave. As this demographic group continues to grow and foster a particular social environment, the children of Punjabi immigrants have forged a unique identity in which they balance the traditional values of their family\u2019s heritage with the intricacies of urban America. The obstacles they face originate because of different structural, communal and cultural reasons. These problems work together to be a heavy burden on the youth of a community that is still very much assimilating into the nation\u2019s landscape. Although there are Punjabi youth from the community who are beginning to access the resources and education they need in order to uplift themselves and their families, much more is needed in order to develop the ability of this first generation group to navigate through the hurdles they face in order to experience the prosperity that their parents dreamed of.",

These homes were owned predominantly by African-Americans and Caribbean immigrant families. Due to her activism, Evelyn and CHASH were able to prevent the demolition of properties on West 131st Street and West 132nd Street. From 1973 to 1976, Evelyn Thomas and her neighbors participated in the \u201cSpruce Up\u201d Program geared towards improving the physical condition of properties on West 131st Street and West 132nd Street. Guided by her leadership, 83 out of 86 houses were rehabilitated despite a lack of federal investment and very limited state and local government resources.",

After struggling with alcohol dependency for many years, he joined Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) in 1980, an entity he considered his lifeline. Feeling welcome at AA, he invested himself into getting well. His faith, determination, and the AA community contributed to his success in reorganizing his life. In 1984, he contributed to the founding of the \u201cAssociation of Merchants and Professionals in Support of the Dominican Liberation Party.\u201d He became close to Professor Juan Bosch, the leader of the Dominican Liberation Party and participated avidly in both the domestic political arena in DR and New York City. He supported various grassroots political candidates, earning a reputation as a distinguished member of the community. In 2002, together with a handful of people, he decided to create the Committee for the Prevention of Alcoholism and Drug Addiction, with the mission of helping alcoholic patients and drug addicts who needed help but were afraid to seek it because of the stigma linked to mental health and substance abuse. Don Carlos, as he was affectionately called, cared deeply about those who helped and their families. He fought to change perceptions and systems that catalogued substance abuse patients as general psychiatry patients, managing that 8 New York hospitals assigned special facilities and targeted responses to care for them. After discharge, he found appropriate homes for participants and helped them join AA, where they had access to a support system as they started their journey towards sobriety. For Carlos, the work with Alcoholics Anonymous became his life mission. He was concerned with sponsoring and giving emotional support to many substance abuse patients. Saving lives for him was a duty and a mission. Not only was he an active member, he founded several AA chapters, mentored countless members, and shared his personal testimony to help others. In addition to his work in caring for substance abuse sufferers, Carlos Mart\u00ednez invested his time and resources in development programs in the DR. He served as President of the famed Dominican \u201cClub de Leones\u201d chapter in Manhattan. He obtained a government grant to offer free prostate cancer early detection tests for those who could not afford it and he volunteered at Lincoln Hospital, where he campaigned to educate and spread information about prostate cancer.

He received support from several medical professionals, businessmen and Dominican merchants.

She lived for a time in Hell\u2019s Kitchen and initiated her career in service to the public good at Hartley House at 413 West 46th Street. She holds an important place in New York City history; on March 25, 1911, while working as Executive Director of the New York office of the National Consumers League, she witnessed the deadly Triangle Shirtwaist Fire on Washington Place in Greenwich Village. This experience galvanized her resolve to improve safety and conditions for workers. She chaired the Committee on Safety that formed in the aftermath and was dedicated to determining the causes and preventing a recurrence. With the Social Security Act she established unemployment benefits, pensions for the many uncovered elderly Americans, and welfare for the poorest Americans. She pushed to reduce workplace accidents and helped craft laws against child labor. Through the Fair Labor Standards Act, she established the first minimum wage and overtime laws for American workers, and defined the standard forty-hour work week. She formed governmental policy working with labor unions and helped to alleviate strikes by way of the United States Conciliation Service. Perkins dealt with urgent labor issues during World War II, when women assumed skilled positions in the munitions and aircraft industries.",

    "reason": "Between 1893 and 1910, this section of West 28th Street between Sixth Avenue and Broadway became known as Tin Pan Alley, often cited as the birthplace of American popular music for making sheet music available to countless American households. Here, composers, arrangers, lyricists, performers, and printers came together as collaborative firms and revolutionized the music industry's practices for the production and promotion of popular music. Such iconic songs as \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" and \"God Bless America\" were published on 28th Street while the sheet music business boomed here at the turn of the 20th century. The designation of this row of five buildings also represents the diverse history of Tin Pan Alley, acknowledging the harsh realities faced by African Americans at the turn of the 20th century, as well as their achievements. Tin Pan Alley's music publishing brought ragtime to an international public, and Jewish and African-American artists and publishers were able to create new and unprecedented opportunities for themselves in mainstream American music. Many went on to gain acclaim and prominence, like Irving Berlin, Harold Arlen, Duke Ellington, George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Noble Sissle, J. Rosamond Johnson, and James Reese Europe, among others.",

He was selected to serve on an elite United States Army intelligence team responsible for breaking Japanese military and diplomatic codes during World War II due to his fluency in Japanese, Latin, French and German. He served with this unit until the end of the war and received, among many honors, the Army Commendation Award and two commendations from the Military Intelligence Division in recognition of his service, contribution and devotion to duty. After completing his military service, he received an L.L.B. from Harvard University School of Law in 1947, later amended to a Juris Doctorate, and began his career as a Law Secretary with the United States Court of Appeals and then as Special Assistant to the U.S. Attorney General. In 1951, he was named a partner in the Washington D.C. law firm of Ford, Bergson, Adams, Borkland & Redstone. Three years later, in 1954, he joined National Amusements and embarked on his celebrated, decades-long career in the entertainment industry. A skilled manager, he helped National Amusements expand to 59 screens by 1964 and 129 screens by 1974. He then began looking for growth opportunities and taking positions in companies specializing in content production. In line with his conviction that \u201ccontent is king,\u201d he began accumulating stock in Twentieth Century Fox, Columbia Pictures and other content companies, all of which he turned over for significant profits when he sold his positions in the 1980s. He was especially passionate about his investment in Viacom and, seeing value in its youth-centric media holdings, purchased a controlling interest in the company in March 1987, for $3.4 billion. He assumed the role of Chairman of Viacom and quickly oversaw a series of acquisitions that would make the company one of the top players in modern media, including the high-profile acquisitions of Paramount Pictures, Blockbuster Entertainment, DreamWorks SKG and CBS. In 1996, he was appointed CEO of Viacom, a position he held through 2005. He served as Chairman of Viacom and CBS until 2016, when he assumed the position of Chairman Emeritus at each company. CBS and Viacom announced an agreement to merge in August 2019, and completed the merger in December 2019, becoming ViacomCBS. Upon the completion of the transaction, he assumed the role of Chairman Emeritus of the combined company.

The afterschool program not only taught basketball and all aspects of the game, but also educated the youth on the detrimental effects of drug use, the importance of education, and life itself. \u201cCoach Al\u201d was a father figure to his students, the neighborhood kids and his basketball players.

During her tenure at the 135th Street Library, she created outreach programming in Spanish, which was unheard of at the time. It was at the 135th Street Library that she found her love for storytelling; and therefore, began her formal schooling in 1926 at the Library School of the New York Public Library. In 1929, she was transferred to the 115th Street Library, where she would stay for the rest of her career. At the 115th Street Library, she instituted bilingual story hours and implemented traditional Puerto Rican holidays into the Library\u2019s schedule. In 1932, she published her first book, P\u00e9rez and Martina, which was a folk tale her grandmother used to tell her while in Puerto Rico. P\u00e9rez and Martina became the first Puerto Rican book to be read at story time in the Library\u2019s history. As a librarian at the 115th Street Library, she metaphorically opened the doors of the Library to the Spanish speaking world. While she not only worked within the library system, she also helped compile the Archivo de Documentaci\u00f3n Puertorrique\u00f1a, which collects original Puerto Rican documents. In 1940, she was invited to the ALA in Cincinnati, Ohio, to present a paper she wrote on working with the Spanish speaking community in East Harlem. She wrote The Three Magi which was published as a part of the anthology The Animals\u2019 Christmas by Anne Thaxter. She compiled short stories titled The Tiger and the Rabbit and Other Tales. This collection became the first Puerto Rican stories to be published in English in the United States. After her husband passed in 1960, she resumed her part time work at the 115th Library as the Spanish Children\u2019s Specialist; however, she travelled from East Harlem to different areas in New York City that had a high concentration of Puerto Rican children to ensure that they had a library to go to. She decided to retire in 1968, but was persuaded to help establish the South Bronx Library Project. This program promotes and provides library use and services to Latino communities in the Bronx.

This meant that Jennifer lacked the tissue necessary to connect both halves of her brain. Unfortunately, the doctors that examined and diagnosed her predicted that she would not survive infancy due to this rare condition, but she would defy those odds living to the age of 28. Despite this diagnosis, her family did everything to ensure that she lived the best life possible and she even took classes through United Cerebral Palsy. In 1996, Jennifer and her family moved to Huguenot where she lived for the rest of her life. Her mother, a special education teacher, was a huge influence in her life as she provided much care for her. Jennifer loved her family deeply and treasured time spent with them, especially when they would eat out at restaurants together. She and one of her brothers would take walks with their mother being pushed down the sidewalk in a wheelchair. She would show affection through her contagious smiles and her famed eye movements. She made a tremendous impact on their lives of all those she met. By defying the odds of her doctors, she served as an inspiration to anyone who met her. Over the years, she would experience numerous seizures and significant mental development disabilities which left her non-verbal. Severe contractions in her body rendered her immobile. While she fought an uphill battle against this disease, she did not stop and continued to live far longer than any doctor could imagine. Jennifer served as a beacon of hope for all those afflicted with corpus callosum agenesis syndromes and many other serious conditions. In hopes of raising awareness of serious diagnoses given to babies like herself, Jennifer and her family were active participants in the March of Dimes organization.

She was the guiding force behind $150 million in capital construction, including the building of North Hall and Library and the Children\u2019s Center, as well as the renovation of the Roscoe Brown Student Center. These projects were mere dreams for many years before President Williams turned them into reality. Her steadfast leadership led to BCC\u2019s student body growing to over 10,000 during her tenure and our diverse faculty increasing by more than 90 full-time educators. She was responsible for the College\u2019s first general education program and first Strategic Plan. Campus centers devoted to student success like the Writing Center, the Math Lab and the Center for Teaching, Learning and Technology were also established during her tenure. Her 15-year tenure was marked by the rapid expansion of BCC\u2019s international presence, including partnerships with schools in Africa. In her own words, that initiative was \u201cnot just study abroad and the influx of international students, but the curriculum and the whole climate of the college. We were able to bring global issues into our community.\u201d At the national level, Dr. Williams was actively involved with the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) and served as the Chairperson in 2000. She also was actively involved in the National Council on Black American Affairs (NCBAA), a council of the AACC. Her work with NCBAA involved the development and mentoring of African American future leaders. To accomplish this goal, the Carolyn Grubbs Williams Leadership Development Institute was established in her honor. The Institute prepares African Americans in community colleges for leadership roles to insure that the pipeline to executive-level positions is fluid. President Williams will always be remembered for her passionate commitment to the students of Bronx Community College. \u201cThe students\u2019 success is our success,\u201d she was fond of saying.

A ten-time Grammy nominee, Cruz, who sang only in her native Spanish language, received a Smithsonian Lifetime Achievement award, a National Medal of the Arts and honorary doctorates from Yale University and the University of Miami. A street in Miami was renamed in her honor, and Cruz' trademark orange, red and white polka dot dress and shoes have been placed in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institute of Technology. The Hollywood Wax Museum includes a statue of the Cuba-born songstress. Celia Cruz was born in Havana, Cuba on October 21, 1924. Growing up in the city\u2019s poor Santo Su\u00e1rez neighborhood in a household of 14 children, she stood out because of her singing ability. Cruz won a singing contest called \u201cLa hora del t\u00e9\u201d and with her mother\u2019s encouragement began to enter other contests in various parts of Cuba. Cruz\u2019s father, however, believed that she should become a teacher, an altogether more common profession for a Cuban woman at the time. She enrolled at the national teachers\u2019 college, but dropped out after finding more and more success with her music in live and radio performances. Something of a compromise was reached when she enrolled at Havana\u2019s National Conservatory of Music\u2014but there a professor encouraged her to consider a full time singing career. Her breakthrough came in 1950 when she became the lead vocalist for a big band called La Sonora Matancer. Bandleader Regilo Martinez showed faith in Cruz when he continued to feature her despite the protests of fans of the band\u2019s previous vocalist, and once again when an American record executive resisted the idea of making a Sonora Matancer disc that featured Cruz, believing that a rumba record with a female vocalist would not sell well. Martinez promised to pay Cruz himself if the recording flopped. It did well in both Cuba and the United States, and Cruz toured widely through Central and North America with La Sonora Matancera in the 1950\u2019s. At the time of the Communist takeover of Cuba in 1959, the group was slated to tour Mexico. However, from Mexico, rather than returning to Cuba, they entered the United States and remained there. Cruz herself became a U.S citizen in 1961. Cuban Communist leader Fidel Castro was furious and barred Cruz from returning to Cuba, enforcing the ban even after Cruz\u2019s parents\u2019 deaths. Cruz for her part vowed not to return to Cuba until such time as the Castro regime was deposed. Celia Cruz died on July 16, 2003 in Fort Lee, New Jersey.",

At the turn of the twentieth Century, the Park District Protective League (PDPL) was an organization of exclusivity, but over the years took on a preservationist role in Riverdale. Riverdale Park was created by the contributions of landowners convinced by the PDPL of the need to protect the green space from the encroaching development of the city. In the 1950\u2019s, the PDPL became the Riverdale Community Planning Association, which went on to champion the rezoning of Riverdale and the environmental protections of the Special Natural Area District regulations. Without the stewardship and influence of John McKelvey, Sr. in those early years, it is quite possible that Riverdale would be a very different place from the place we call home today. His contribution to the modern development of the Spuyten Duyvil community was noted in obituaries both local and national, when he passed away in 1947 at the age of 84. His practice of law included a preservationist vision which resonates today in the picturesque tranquility of our green space and our sustained commitment to a planned and balanced community, and for this inspiration we owe him great thanks.",

She devoted her personal life to the compassionate care of her elderly mother suffering from Alzheimer\u2019s disease and with whom she lived in the same apartment in Jackson Heights for over 40 years. She published a paper in 2008 while at the New York Academy of Medicine on the needs of older immigrants and their perspective on growing older in New York City. Because of her personal experience caring for her own mother and the knowledge she amassed researching about the health outcomes of older New Yorkers, she strongly advocated for better access to comprehensive health care services for elderly migrants. Chiqui also maintained close connections with other community advocates and public servants as a way to help promote much needed policy changes for migrant women, youth and the elderly.",

    "reason": "Peter Magnani left an indelible mark on the built environment of Queens through his life\u2019s work as an architect and city planner. He shepherded the creation of many of the most important public buildings in the borough over the past 35 years. Peter viewed all his projects through the lens of how they would promote the welfare and quality of life of the community. Fairness, equality and balance were his motivating principles. Queens is home to more green spaces, beautiful libraries and other architecturally noteworthy public buildings thanks to his vision and expertise. Peter started his career in the public sector in 1968 in the Bronx Office of City Planning, rising by 1977 to the position of director. In 1980, he assumed the same post at the Queens Office of City Planning, the borough where he was born and where he lived. In this role, Peter advocated for a mixed-zoning plan for Long Island City to protect the area\u2019s factories and industrial production and the current owners of single-family homes from unchecked high-rise development. His plan permitted construction or expansion of light industry and one- and two-family houses. The plan also called for the preservation for public use of Long Island City\u2019s waterfront, which was no longer heavily used by industry. With an eye to balance and job growth, Peter also got Planning Commission approval for the Citicorp Office Tower in Long Island City. His work set the stage for the current development of Long Island City. In 1986, Claire Shulman asked Peter to become her deputy. Over the next 16 years as deputy borough president, he planned and implemented the Queens West mixed-use waterfront development and championed the building of the new Queens Hospital Center, the Flushing Meadow Corona Park Olympic swimming pool and ice rink, the Queens Hall of Science addition and Queens Borough Public Library at Flushing. Following Peter\u2019s advice, Shulman allocated funding in the 1990s to restore sections of the 34th Avenue median between 69th Street and Junction Boulevard that had been removed in the 1960s. In the spring of 2020, thanks in part to that green median bisecting the street, 34th Avenue became one of New York City\u2019s most successful Open Street projects. In 2002, he became the director of capital program management for the Queens Borough Public Library. In that role, he oversaw the largest and most successful building program in the history of the library. The Children\u2019s Library Discovery Center in Jamaica, Queens, and notable new branch libraries in Long Island City, Glen Oaks, Elmhurst, Far Rockaway and Hunters Point were all built during his tenure. Peter was instrumental in the selection of Steven Holl and his \u201cBeacon of Light\u201d design concept for the new Hunters Point branch near the waterfront. \u201cThe idea is to use natural elements, such as the sun, wind and greenery on the roof to help insulate the building,\u201d Peter wrote. In addition to the construction of new library buildings, he brought all the branches of the Queens Borough Public Library into the 21st century by installing machines that library patrons could use to check out books on their own. In addition to his work as a city planner and builder, he played an instrumental role in the Towers Coop, his home of nearly 53 years in Jackson Heights. In the 1970s, he led a successful tenant-sponsored conversion of this complex of 120 rental apartments into a cooperative and became the founding president of the coop\u2019s board. Jackson Heights was referred to as the \u201cCocaine Capital\u201d by New York Magazine at the time, and the success of the Towers conversion to coop status helped stabilize the neighborhood. In 2010, the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects awarded Peter its Public Architect Award for achieving architectural design excellence in the public realm.",

The group also orchestrates the popular Prospect Lefferts Gardens House and Garden Tour. The LMA also publishes the Echo. He had the longest tenure of any LMA president since the group\u2019s founding a century ago. He persuaded the Landmarks Preservation Commission to issue advice instead of fines when several homeowners in recent years ran afoul of the historic district\u2019s exterior rehab codes, especially as it related to window replacement. Working with then Brooklyn Borough President Marty Markowitz, funds were found for all of PLG to receive wrought-iron tree guards throughout the neighborhood. He managed to get the city to live up to a promise it made years earlier with the installation of the historic Bishop\u2019s Crook lampposts that line the Manor\u2019s blocks. He helped bring landmark status to the stately limestone block on Ocean Avenue near Lincoln Road. Beyond his long presidency of the LMA, he served nearly ten years as a board member and most recently treasurer on CB, and he was a longstanding member of the Police Community Council. He did all that and more while working as an associate broker at a Century franchise, earning the real estate chain\u2019s \u201c21st Century Achiever\u201d honor. He was a bulwark against predatory development and spent a lot of time challenging the ambitions of realtors and developers who set their targets on PLG.",

    "reason": "Theofan Stilian Noli, known as Fan Noli, was an Albanian writer, scholar, diplomat, politician, historian, orator, and founder of the Orthodox Church of Albanian, who served as Prime Minister. Fan Noli is venerated by Albanians as a champion of literature, history, theology, diplomacy, journalism, music, and national unity. He played an important role in the consolidation of Albanian as the national language of Albania with numerous translations of world literature masterpieces. He also wrote extensively in English: as a scholar and author of a series of publications, religious texts, and translations. He produced a translation of the New Testament in English, The New Testament of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ from the approved Greek text of the Church of Constantinople and the Church of Greece, published in 1961. Noli earned degrees at Harvard (1912), the New England Conservatory of Music (1938), and finally his Ph.D. from Boston University (1945). In 1912, under the leadership of Fan Noli, the Pan-Albanian Federation of America, known as Vatra (The Hearth) was created. Based in Boston, Vatra at the height of its influence had 72 branches throughout the United States. The federation has historically protected the rights of the Albanians in the United States, as well lobbying with the United States Congress about the rights of the Albanians throughout the world. Today, Vatra Federation continues to be a vibrant home to its many branches across the nation, New York, Michigan, Florida, Massachusetts, and Canada. Both, Vatra and its newspaper \u201cDielli\u201d serve as community staple and are based in the Bronx, which is the largest Albanian Community in United States. Fan Noli was the Chief-editor of the newspaper \u201cDielli\u201d (The Sun) \u2013 which began as a publication of the Boston Albanian society \u201cBesa-Besen\u201d from February 1909, until July 1911. He was ordained a priest at Saint Nicholas Cathedral in New York City in 1908, establishing thereby the Albanian Church and elevating the Albanian language to ecclesiastic use. He briefly resided in Albania after the 1912 declaration of independence. After World War I, Noli led the diplomatic efforts for the reunification of Albania and received the support of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson. Later he pursued a diplomatic-political career in Albania, successfully leading the Albanian bid for membership in the League of Nations. Noli\u2019s eloquence in pleading Albania\u2019s cause won him many enthusiastic supporters among the great statesmen of the postwar era, notably President Woodrow Wilson. Largely due to Noli\u2019s impassioned pleas, Wilson fought vigorously for the right of Albania and other small nations to determine their own futures. The London Daily Mail, noting Noli\u2019s great skills in diplomacy, hailed as the ablest of Balkan statesmen and suggested that his colleagues in neighboring countries could learn much from him A memorandum was sent to U. S. President Wilson and Secretary of State Lansing a few days before a delegation of Albanian-Americans, led by Fan Noli left for France to take part in the Paris Peace Conference of 1919. Copies of the memorandum were sent to the foreign ministries of the Allied Powers and their ambassadors in Washington. The aim of the text and of the delegation was to ensure the continued recognition of Albania as a sovereign state. Many of the idealized views expressed in this memorandum, can still be heard among Albanians today. In 1932, Metropolitan Theophan Noli was granted permanent resident status and he returned permanently to the U.S. He had spent eight years in Germany while he waited for this visa. After his return to the U.S.A., he withdrew from political life, and he returned to his duties as the head of the Albanian Orthodox Church in North America. Paralleling his life of service in the Orthodox Church, Noli remained active in politics. An unsurpassed multitalented figure of influence, Fan Noli has been a subject of volumes of publications and research. A Harvard alum and later dual citizen who spent most of his life in the United States, Fan Noli shined in many walks of life: literature, journalism, publications, translations, theology, religious leadership, diplomacy, politics, music and helped shape the foundations of the Albanian nation. Master of 14 languages, a distinguished Shakespearean scholar and translator as well as an accomplished historian. Blessed by the American freedom of expression, which Noli admired, he was a leader in the Albanian-American community for many decades.",

She was a determined community leader and a compassionate woman who dedicated her life to her family and public service. She was an iconic figure at Roberto Clemente Plaza/Kent Village in Williamsburg. As a consummate mental health professional during some of Williamsburg\u2019s most challenging years, she saved hundreds of lives. She helped families and individuals cope with depression, bipolar disorders, and other health issues. When New York State proposed closing the Kingsboro Psychiatric Center in the community where her patients were a priority, she helped lead the campaign to keep the Williamsburg center open, keeping jobs in the local neighborhood. She drew great inspiration in serving as a mentor and role model to young people. She founded a youth marching band that participated in local public events. As a Family Worker at Public School 17, Ms. Torres founded the first majorette group in Williamsburg, the Unidad y Progreso Baton Twirlers (translated as United for Progress Baton Twirlers) later renamed Blossoms. She personally solicited fabric donations from neighborhood merchants and hand-tailored the group\u2019s uniforms to ensure equal participation regardless of ethnicity and socio-economic status. The majorettes achieved acclaim through participation in the Puerto Rican Day and other local parades, and they invited to perform in many surrounding community events. Ms. Torres received donations and gifts of instruments for a youth marching band and later a youth baseball team. The group\u2019s intention was to establish several important goals including pride for and appreciation of cultural heritage which Elisa believed preserved traditions and family values and fostered self-esteem. Ms. Torres gained valuable professional insight as a Mental Health Therapy Assistant and later as a Psychiatric Social Worker and Mental Hygiene Therapist in the mental health field for Kingsboro Psychiatric Center, where she was Employee of the Year in 1981. Her experiences in the home, at work, and in the community led Ms. Torres to broader interests in all areas of social concern. She pursued a degree in Human Services from Boricua College and Kingsboro Community College and through her research and studies, she became an expert in the process of government policymaking and the methodology needed to deliver quality services. This enabled her to better promote the concept of social justice which drove her purpose. In the late 70\u2019s, Ms. Torres moved to Roberto Clemente Plaza where together with an equally committed group of concerned parents, she formed a committee to focus on Hispanic leadership and youth activities ensuring exposure to and inclusion of other ethnicities as well. In 1981, Ms. Torres, was instrumental in organizing the Roberto Clemente Festival which was broadcasted on radio and televised in Puerto Rico. The Festival served as an opportunity for community residents to share the cultural heritage of Puerto Rico. In 1984 and under her leadership, Roberto Clemente Cultural Committee, Inc. was established and incorporated a youth baseball and recreation park to serve children ages 6-12. To accomplish this Ms. Torres worked diligently to transform an abandoned lot into a first-class ball field worthy of its namesake, the legendary Roberto Clemente. In 1992, after 20 years of perseverance and hard work, plans for the Roberto Clemente Baseball Field were approved and Ms. Torres worked closely with the Parks department to secure permits and registered the little league with Williamsport Pennsylvania and received the charter, In addition to the baseball field, other programs such as Head Start, after school programs, the Blossoms Majorettes and Marching Drums, Three King\u2019s Day, Heritage Month, Rosario de la Cruz, and Puerto Rico Discovery Day were founded. Ms. Torres would move on to coordinate participation in the Somos El Futuro Conference in Albany, New York for community residents and local businesses. Funding for these programs was obtained through the assistance and sponsorship of Assemblyman Joseph R. Lentil and community businesses. Ms. Torres was a member of a number of community organizations including Brooklyn Unidos, Seneca Democratic Club, Brooklyn Day Parade Inc., 90th Pct. Council, former Secretary of Pioneros de Puertorriquenos, Vice-Present of Club Hijos de Humacao Inc., 3rd Vice-President of Woodhull Auxiliary Board, founding member of Musica Against Drugs and founding Secretary of La Fiesta Folklorica Puertorriquena. In recognition of her remarkable accomplishments and contributions, in 1994 she received the State of New York Legislative Resolution from the Assembly. In 1999, she received a proclamation from the Council of the City of New York among other community awards.",

    "reason": "Bishop Roberts, Sr. immigrated to the United States and settled in Harlem, New York, where he worked as an elevator operator in a commercial building. He became a member of the Holy Cross Cathedral Orthodox Church and at night pursued a degree in theological studies. He later became a postulant in the Endich Theological Seminary under the tutelage of his Eminence Georg Alexander McGuire. Upon completion of his theological training, he was admitted to the Holy Orders as a Bishop. Bishop Roberts was drawn to organizations that advocated for black self-determination and racial equality and joined the Jamaican-born Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). The first branch of the UNIA in the U.S. was founded in New York in 1917, with the aims of repatriation, promoting racial pride, and the need to develop more independent African states. Bishop Roberts was committed to the spiritual well-being of his Harlem community, which included Caribbean immigrants and African- American migrants from the southern states. Inspired to establish a community-based church, St. Thomas Liberal Catholic Church was established on December 21, 1926 in the village of Harlem. Under the leadership of Bishop James P. Roberts, Sr., the church grew quickly and had to be relocated several times to accommodate its growth. Ultimately, a permanent structure was purchased at 147 West 144th Street in Harlem. Bishop Roberts was truly a spiritual pioneer in Harlem. Today, his son James P. Roberts Jr., serves as the church's bishop. In 1934, Bishop Roberts established The Antigua Progressive Society to provide charitable assistance to his beloved Harlem community and the island of Antigua. The objective was to \"foster friendship, promote and cultivate social, economic, and intellectual intercourse among its members, along with supporters to render aid in time of need, sickness, or death.\" The Society was incorporated in 1935 in New York State with an overarching mission to be \"a beacon of light to all.\" The Antigua Progressive Society later merged with another organization and renamed themselves the Antigua and Barbuda Progressive Society (ABPS). In 1964, the ABPS purchased a building located at 12 West 122nd Street in the village of Harlem which became its headquarters. That building is fondly referred to as the \"Antigua and Barbuda House.\" ABPS continues to operate from this building eighty-five years after its founding in one of Harlem's Historical districts at 122nd Street and Lenox Avenue. Today, the Antigua and Barbuda Progressive Society, Inc. is a 50l(c) (3) organization exclusively supporting charitable, religious and educational purposes. In 2012, the society donated the first 50 years of its records to the Manuscripts, Archives, and Rare Books Division at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. The following year, a public exhibit at the Schomburg Center titled \"A Lighthouse in New York,\" show cased the records and accomplishments of ABPS. The ABPS continues the legacy of Bishop James P, Roberts, Sr., by actively engaging in the Harlem community. Among the activities, ABPS has adopted the Drew Family Day Care Center in Harlem where our annual \"Holiday Toy Drive\" brings joy to the children and the families of the center. ABPS also supported the Shades of Truth Theater. We have partnered with the local churches such as: Ephesus Seventh-Day Adventist Church, Greater Calvary Baptist Church and the Beulah Wesleyan Methodist Church. We also support women's homeless shelter, organize local book drives for children to promote literacy, serve Thanksgiving Dinner, as well as provide \"take out\" dinners at our headquarters. In our homeland of Antigua & Barbuda, we host an annual blood drive at Mount Saint John Medical Centre in Antigua. The APBS has a strong connection with the local Harlem community and actively helps to foster transnational connections with communities back in Antigua. More importantly, the society has been able to successfully engage younger members and encourage their participation within the society, which has ultimately led to the growth of its membership.",

Following graduate study at Columbia, she served as a poet-in-residence at Tougaloo College in Mississippi, where she focused on feminist theory, race studies, and LGBTQ rights. Later, after teaching stints at CUNY\u2019s Lehman College and John Jay College, she became Distinguished Thomas Hunter professor at Hunter College in 1981\u2014returning to her alma mater to inspire a new generation of Hunter students to raise their voices against injustice.

    "reason": "Victor Jos\u00e9 Victor Rojas was born in Santiago de los Caballeros. His professional life began in 1972, with the authorship of La Casita (The Little House), which he sang with Wilfrido Vargas. This piece became such a great success that it inspired the budding author to launch his career as a performer and composer, work that kept him busy for the rest of his life. In the 1970s, his dissatisfaction with domestic politics and economic policies in DR, added to increasing international turmoil, inspired him to write songs with social and political content as his aesthetic compass. Mr. V\u00edctor also took part in the movement opposed to the Dominican dictator Rafael Trujillo, and he began to write protest songs. As a young man he traveled the country as part of youth groups protesting the government while receiving an education in local rhythms. Between 1973 and 1978, he founded and led the group Nueva Fortuna, with which he traveled all over the country. In 1978, he created the group Flamboy\u00e1n, through which he projected his music as a sample of rhythmic intermixing. For five years he shared the stage with the most important figures of the Latin American song and performed in Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Cuba, the United States and Italy. Victor Victor studied the musical roots of merengue and bachata, recreated the genre and enriched it. Successes such as \u201cMesita de noche\u201d, \u201cAndo buscando un amor\u201d y \u201cAs\u00ed es mi amor\u201d were made with simplicity and beautiful metaphors and have been performed by leading Dominican and foreign vocalists. In 1990, he released his fourth album, entitled \u201cUn chin de veneno\u201d, which was an international success. It succesfully fuses Caribbean rhythms in a new style. Victor Victor has to his credit the long-running albums entitled \u201c \u03cc00c1lbum rojo\u201d, \u201cFlamboyan\u201d, \u201cCon sus flores y sus vainas\u201d, \u201cCotidiano\u201d, \u201cArtistas por la paz\u201d, \u201cInspiraciones\u201d, \u201cTu coraz\u00f3n\u201d y \u201cAlma de Barrio\u201d. In 2007, he recorded the social-themed album \u201cVerde y negro\u201d as a tribute to the freedom fighters of the Dominican Republic. Victor died of COVID-19 at a hospital in Santo Domingo at age 71. The artist was awarded the Awards: Premios A Lo Nuestro, Aplauso 92, Ronda, ACE, Aplauso 98, ASCAP and ONDA. Victor Victor remains a beloved and influential artist for hundreds of thousands of Dominicans in New York City.",

In 1952, he returned to Israel as Deputy Director General of the Defense Ministry and the next year was promoted to Director General, the top post, at the age of 29. Later in his career, Peres succeeded Yitzhak Rabin as Acting Prime Minister briefly during 1977, before becoming Prime Minister from 1984 to 1986. As Foreign Minister, under Prime Minister Rabin, he engineered the 1994 Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty, and won the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize together with Rabin and Yasser Arafat for the Oslo Accords peace talks with the Palestinian leadership.

The reforms were necessary because the TLC only targeted Hispanic and black livery drivers with unnecessary tickets, summons and fines. In 1983, he began what was to become the biggest SALSA Festival and Carnival in the Bronx. (El Festival de Los Taxistas) The Non medallion Taxi Festival. Held during the Labor Day weekend, it attracted tens of thousands of spectators from around the City.

NQ began its work in 1992, when NYC proposed a Melrose renewal plan, which designated 35 blocks to be developed for middle-income New Yorkers. This site, however, was already home to roughly 6,000 low-income Melrose residents. Outraged by the injustice of their proposed displacement, the local community banded together to create the We Stay/Nos Quedamos Committee in 1993. This Committee drafted and passed an alternative proposal, the Melrose Commons Urban Renewal Plan, resulting in the development of affordable housing for over 4,000 families and seniors and nearly one million square feet of commercial real estate space. NQ was the first nonprofit to successfully utilize the City\u2019s 197a process to create a plan for our own community that preserved all that was valuable to long-time residents. As innovators of the \u201cMelrose Urban Renewal Plan,\u201d NQ has had an unprecedented impact on the positive growth of a region that was once seen as \u2018disposable,\u2019 and helped to create a vibrant and diverse community that has become a one-of-a-kind case study of how community power can be transformative. Each year, dozens of urban planners, scholars and community organizations come to NQ to learn about the historical community-led victory that was undertaken. NQ has since served as a leader in community-driven development and provides critical support for Melrose residents, assisting with a variety of economic, social, and environmental issues. NQ\u2019s recent successes include engaging, organizing, and educating tenants around larger issues of affordable housing by helping them form tenant leadership teams; collaborating with artists, arts and culture organizations, and related stakeholders to preserve and amplify the cultural DNA of the South Bronx by creating a comprehensive map of cultural assets in Melrose and Morissania; and working with Melrose community gardens to support the preservation of open space and community resilience.

The \u201ccrack\u201d epidemic hit it very hard and the \u201cblocks\u201d that made up Watson had to become a family to provide a safety net. He believed that he could save the youth and raise the standards of the community even when everyone wanted to give up. In 1979, he opened a social club called the \u201cGreen House,\u201d to give the people a place to relax. He would offer food, drinks, and entertainment to escape the negative world around them. He started block parties that grew over the years to celebrate the people in the community. He would build a stage out of old doors he collected, and the youth took on leadership roles with organizing the events. These block parties were the foundation for many of the major events in the Bronx. The children were exposed to horses, fun games, music, and lots of great food. He converted a basement into a video game hall and pool room to keep the youth off the streets. When interest in that waned, he started softball teams called the \"Superstars\" and gave the community access to organized sports at a time where schools were cutting these programs. These teams became a league, where instead of people shooting and killing each other, they competed on the baseball diamond. During the summer while all parents worked menial jobs to make ends meet, he opened his home, his backyard and his heart to everyone. Luis Angel Torres and his wife, Elizabeth, fed thousands of people, and provided a safe place for the youth.

The Police and Fire Departments looked to him whenever they needed support with issues in the community. He taught the youth to respect the police, and the police to respect our community. He always invited the police to be part of his events so that the youth could see them in a positive way. The children in the community would maintain the buildings and worked to improve the conditions of the neighborhood under his leadership. Many of the youth, now adults, credit him with saving their lives and providing them with a foundation to be able to start and support their own families.

    "reason": "Colin Luther Powell was born on April 5, 1937, and reared in the ethnically mixed Hunts Point section of the South Bronx. His parents, Luther Powell, a shipping-room foreman in Manhattan\u2019s garment district, and Maud Ariel McKoy, a seamstress, were immigrants from Jamaica. Mr. Powell was a pathbreaker, serving as the country\u2019s first Black national security adviser, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and secretary of state. The young Mr. Powell graduated from Morris High School in the Bronx, before attending City College of New York. An early turning point in Mr. Powell\u2019s life came when he enrolled in the college\u2019s Reserve Officer Training Corps program, drawn by the camaraderie it fostered, the discipline it imposed and its well-defined goals. Cadet Powell joined the Pershing Rifles, a drill team started by Gen. John J. Pershing, a top American commander in World War I. After graduating from City College in June 1958, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Army, serving two decorated combat tours in Vietnam. Mr. Powell rose quickly through the ranks \u2014 including gaining a battalion command in Korea in 1973 and a brigade command in the elite 101st Airborne Division in 1976. He was tapped as a \u201cwater walker\u201d by his peers, a term military men reserve for the most talented officers. In 1979, Mr. Powell, then 42, was promoted to one-star general, becoming the youngest general officer in the Army at the time. After serving as Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger\u2019s senior military assistant, Mr. Powell, in the spring of 1986, went off to command V Corps, skipping division command altogether in leading 75,000 soldiers in West Germany in the waning years of the Cold War. Just five months later, President Reagan summoned him back to Washington to be national security adviser, a post in which he played a pivotal role in helping to usher in a new era of cooperation with Mr. Gorbachev. Mr. Powell left the White House in 1989 to return to lead the Army\u2019s Forces Command; the promotion made him only the fourth Black four-star general in Army history. He saw himself not only as a model for Black soldiers but also as a challenge to white bigotry. In October 1989, Mr. Powell succeeded Adm. William J. Crowe as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, leapfrogging over 14 more senior four-star officers. Mr. Powell retired from the Joint Chiefs in 1993. He returned to government in December 2000, when he was the first person appointed to the cabinet of President-elect George W. Bush. He left office in January 2005, returning to life as a private citizen. Mr. Powell passed away from complications caused by COVID-19 on Oct. 18, 2021, at the age of 84.",

Facilities include the original site, nine satellites, a mental health facility, twelve school health programs, three part-time facilities, and six administrative/program sites. UHP began in 1974 as an evolution of a group practice with the mission of providing basic and specialty medical care, comparable to those found in local hospital outpatient clinics, to the community\u2019s predominantly Hispanic and poor residents. Originated by Dr. Richard Izquierdo, a life-long resident of the South Bronx and a pediatrician and family practitioner who was concerned by his community\u2019s declining health status, and unable to meet the demand for primary medical services in his private practice, he sought to expand his practice into an HMO-type practice that offered care in a consistent, cost effective, and managed manner. As a result of the lack of primary care services in the area, many residents had grown accustomed to waiting in long lines in local hospital emergency rooms for routine medical care or for the treatment of acute medical conditions, which could have been prevented if diagnosed earlier. Dr. Izquierdo opened the San Juan Health Center in 1967. Seven years later, UHP, a private, non-profit corporation licensed by the Department of Health was established to broaden the scope of the work started by the San Juan Health Center.
